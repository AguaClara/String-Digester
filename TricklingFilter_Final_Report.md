## Abstract

The objective for this semester was identifying problems with trickling filters and determining possibly solutions. After an extensive literature review, two bench scale experiments were conducted. The first was to characterize the hydraulic behavior of a trickling filter and the flow of water through its packing media. The team used this information to identify the areas within the system with the greatest potential for improvements. From this information, the first prototype was built using strings to control flow paths and create a high surface area to volume ratio. Preliminary tests were conducted on the prototype to determine flow dispersion, residence time, and optimal string spacing.

## Introduction

The creation of the trickling filter subteam was prompted by the need for further treatment of wastewater following Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) treatment. A UASB reactor consists of a suspended sludge blanket which filters incoming wastewater. The wastewater enters the reactor from the bottom and flows upward through through the sludge blanket. UASB treatment efficiently treats the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of wastewater, but there are high concentrations of nutrient loading in the wastewater in Honduras. Wastewater that is not treated can transmit diseases and add nutrients to water systems. Excessive nutrients in water systems can decrease dissolved oxygen and also cause toxic algal blooms. Trickling filters can be used to decrease the nutrient and BOD content of wastewater

The overall objective with respect to the treatment capacity of the system, is to first identify the primary issues in industrial-scale trickling filters. Using this information, the team aims to deploy an efficient, non-mechanized trickling filter which can be adapted to serve the wastewater needs of a resource-scarce community. The team's primary aim is to assess the feasibility of the inclusion of a trickling filter in a future AguaClara wastewater treatment plant.

A trickling filter is a biological reactor used in secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment to remove organic matter and nutrients. Settled wastewater is spread evenly by the distribution arm across the filter media, which can be rocks, gravel, or plastic media, among other things. The filter media is cultured with a productive biofilm which grows on the media and degrades the organic matter and nutrients that come into contact with it as the water trickles through.

Trickling filters were heavily researched in the 1970's and 1980's but the industry witnessed a dramatic decline in literature in the years following. The wastewater research after 1980 switch to more energy intensive methods of treatment, like activated sludge. These processes have a higher removal efficiency, but require massive amounts of energy. One aspects that is central to AguaClara's mission is to use as little (or no) electricity. Therefore, a passive treatment like trickling filters only require the energy for water to make it to the top of the filter. This is especially important in regions where electricity is not available or consistent.
The team believes with modern technologies and new information, trickling filters can achieve a high performance level. This can be done by improving by maximizing the utilization rates of the biofilm surface areas and nutrient removal performance for the system. The team strives to make significant technological improvements on industry-standard applications for the system.

When using a sentence like "The wastewater research switched to more active methods of treatment like activated sludge; however, passive treatments like trickling filters have low energy requirements, if any." you want both parts of the sentence to be logically connected.

I understand that you mean that trickling filters have low energy requirements which are advantageous in electricity scarce areas, but this sentence is saying "The research has shifted focus but the filters are low energy" which on its own, doesn't make sense. Try expressing this idea differently.

Implementation of a non-mechanized trickling filter system such as the one described in the paragraph above, is beneficial a wastewater treatment plant in terms of economic and operational sustainability. Eliminating the need of any proprietary, mechanized components opens an opportunity for cost savings and will ultimately extend the usable life of the plant. Any mechanical components added to the system present a point of failure. By removing these moving parts, the system will be able to operate for longer durations with a less-intensive maintenance schedule. This will save money and time in the long run for the plant operations.

 Trickling filter research saw a significant decline several decades ago due to the advent of aeration tanks and other more efficient but high energy processes, and so recent progress in the field has been very limited. Therefore, the team believe's with modern technologies and new information, trickling filters can be improved upon in maximizing the utilization rates of the biofilm surface areas and nutrient removal performance for the system. The team strives to make significant technological improvements on industry-standard applications for the system.

## Literature Review

#### Trickling Filter Operational Difficulties
There is significant documentation of problems plant operators experienced when dealing with trickling filters. Some of the issues, while important to take into consideration when implementing trickling filters, may not offer much room in terms of what improvements the team can make. Such problems include: the development of slug populations in the trickling filters, which can remove the layer of biofilm and harm the nitrifying bacteria population, thereby negatively impacting the systems performance and plug the channels of the system; filter flies, whose presence suggests a lack of moisture throughout the filter; and foul odors, which can indicate an increasing level of anaerobic reactions or accumulating sloughed-off biomass in the filter media. Addressing pest-control issues is not a priority for the team at this time, as there are greater improvements to be made elsewhere.

However, some of these previously mentioned problems (biomass sloughing and insect and slug presence in filters) contribute to clogging and ponding in filters, which the team does aim to address. Current solutions include “flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass” or periodic flooding. The team aims avoid the problem altogether by developing a new trickling media that has a lower tendency to experience clogging or ponding, so that period flooding or other solutions are not necessary.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Where do you mention biomass sloughing in the previous paragraph?

Change "period" to to "periodic" in the last sentence.
</div>

There can be issues with variations in temperature: biofilm thickness changes seasonally and can be low quality and uneven in cold temperatures. In freezing weather, formation of ice can cause clogging and therefore structural damage to the trickling media. These are generally not major concerns for plants in equatorial regions, and so while important to note, will not be a focus for the team at this point.

 Ali et al. states that the most common problem in trickling filters is uncontrolled sloughing, which is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media.  This can be particularly problematic after storm events when flooding results in very high hydraulic loading. It can also be caused by clogging of the distribution arm and uneven distribution of the influent [(Ali et al. 2017).](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf) There is potential for the development of a much-improved distribution system that could help to alleviate this problem.

 Proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of distribution is rotating distributors, but after seeing the problems with them at the Cayuga Heights wastewater treatment plant (see Case Study section for details), the team was interested in learning more about other methods that might require less maintenance or be less prone to failure.

The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system, utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the medium, spaced to give uniform distribution of water. They generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. They are more commonly used with intermittent dosing, so flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filter).

Unfortunately, these systems are also prone to clogging or blockage issues and similarly challenged by inconsistency of hydraulic load on the surface of the trickling filter. This is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.

### Kinetics

Kinetics are used to model the removal efficiencies of biological plants. The team believes that the best way to improve filter performance is to improve the kinetics of the filter. Therefore below is a literature review of kinetic models and possible solutions to increase removal.
#### BOD Kinetic Model

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Make this header smaller to show it as a subheading
</div>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
Comment has been corrected
</div>

The trickling filter team assumed that the majority of BOD will be removed by the UASB reactor. Therefore the trickling filter will be mostly removing nutrients (i.e. Nitrogen and Phosphorus). The team could not find consistent literature on a kinetic model for the removal of nitrogen or phosphorus, only empirical kinetic models exist. Therefore, the team is using the modified Velz BOD kinetic model with the assumption that nutrient removal would be proportional to BOD removal. Nutrient removal equations discussed later validate this assumption. The most common kinetic model for trickling filters is the modified Velz Equation.

 <div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
 Is there a name for the common BOD kinetic model?

 I'm a bit confused bc you say that nutrient removal kinetic equations don't exist but then use nutrient removal equations as justifications for using the BOD kinetic model. Flesh this out a bit.

 Also what are the importance of kinetic equations?
 </div>

The modified Velz Equation from [Logan et. al. 1987](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true):

$C_{out} =\frac{C_{in}}{(R+1)e^{\frac{k_{20}A_{s}H\theta^{T-20}}{Q_{i}(R+1)^{n}}}- R}$

Where:
* $C_{out}=$ The $BOD_{5}$ leaving the filter
* $C_{in}=$ The $BOD_{5}$ entering the filter
* $R=$  The recycle ratio defined as the ratio of recirculation flow to the plant influent flow
* $k_{20}=$ The kinetic constant/treatability coefficient
* $A_{s}=$ The specific surface area
* $H=$ The filter height
* $\theta=$ an empirical correction factor typically set equal to 1.035
* $T=$ Temperature in degrees C
* $Q_{i}=$ The flow before recycle divided by filter cross sectional area

The team's preliminary design for the filter would not include any recycle, therefore the equation simplifies to:

$C_{out} ={C_{in}}{e^{\frac{-k_{20}A_{s}H\theta^{T-20}}{Q_{i}^{n}}}}$

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
How does the denominator end up in the numerator? (I might've forgotten how to math)
</div>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
I made it a negative power to move it to the numerator
</div>

The main points of improvement based on the kinetic model would be to change any of the variables in the equation to increase removal (i.e $C_{in} - C_{out}$). These points of improvement are to increase the height/depth of the filter, increase the surface area, increase temperature, or increase the $k_{20}$ value.

#### Increasing Temperature
The teams assumption is that the wastewater treatment plants would be built outside without heating or air conditioning. Separately using an anaerobic digester to digest sludge and heat the filter would be an option that future teams could look into. Since the pilot plant is expected to be installed in Honduras, temperature in the filter will be in the optimal range for bacterial growth. Although the kinetic model does not have a cap on temperature, the team does not want to raise the temperature too high as to kill the bacteria. The team did not investigate other heating mechanisms because heating large volumes usually requires a lot of energy, for little payoff.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Consider revising for flow
</div>

#### Increasing Height of filter
The team is looking for a novel design that can make traditional filters more cost-effective. The team does not believe that there is a lot of room for improvement in just changing the height of the filter. This is because increasing height of the filter increases the cost of production exponentially. Therefore the team did not investigate this further.

#### Increasing the Specific Surface Area
Specific surface area is surface area per volume. In order to change the specific surface area of the filter the packing material must be changed. To increase specific surface area, the packing material must have more surface area for the same amount of volume. In many trickling filters in Honduras, the packing material is gravel or rocks. In the US, there has been a lot of research and development of new higher specific surface area packing materials. These materials have a more honeycomb structure. Many of these materials are very expensive and would not fit with AguaClara low-cost model. From these materials though the team can learn what properties improve filter performance and mimic them in a more cost effective material. An important consideration discussed later is oxygen availability. In order to keep it an aerobic environment, particle separation has to be large enough to break surface tension. Therefore the team thinks that changing the surface are and not the volume of the packing material will produce the most effective trickling filter.

</div>

#### Increasing the $k_{20}$ Value
There is a very little available research on $k_{20}$ values of different trickling filters. Most research reports just state the value for the filters they were testing. The $k_{20}$ value is the removal coefficient of the specific bacterial culture used at 20 degrees Celsius. A reasonable $k_{20}$ value for an aerobic sludge reactor would be 0.20.

##### Ideas for improvement
* Using different bacterial cultures that are more effective at removing nitrogen and Phosphorus to grow on the filter
* Ensuring that aeration reaches all areas of the filter, therefore keeping the bacteria functioning at a high rate

My concern with the "ideas for improvement" subheaders, is it makes it difficult for me as the to find information when looking back because it segments the report more.
</div>

#### Flow Distributions
An assumption of this model is that the entire volume of the trickling filter is being used. The team believes that there may be unused volume for the trickling filter that is not getting any flow because the water takes another path with less resistance, and therefore not fuly treating the water. Therefore the team will also conduct experiments to determine how flow is distributed. After these tests, the team determined how to use a packing material and filter design that utilizes all of the available space.

### Nitrogen Kinetic Models
The EPA has complied information from many trickling filters across the US that are used for nitrification. They found that bacteria that preform nitrification, usually Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, cannot compete against the BOD removing heterotrophs when the BOD levels are high. The EPA suggests that BOD levels be below $20 \frac{mg}{L}$, with the optimal value of $10 \frac{mg}{L}$. The chemical reactions that the nitrifying bacteria are performing are:

$NH_{4}^{+}  + 1.5 O_{2} \rightarrow NO_{2}^{-} + 2H^{+} +  H_{2}O$

$NO_{2}^{-}  + 0.5 O_{2} \rightarrow NO_{3}^{-}$.

When the EPA report was written no kinetic model had been derived for nitrification in trickling filters; however, they found four main parameters that increased removal was based on: low organic loadings, high residence times, sufficient oxygen availability, and consistency in hydraulic, organic, and ammonia loadings [(US EPA, 1991)](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P1004T3S.PDF?Dockey=P1004T3S.PDF). [Duddles et. al., 1974](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25038735.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A134b4fcdcce29130f630db8059aa3119) found that nitrification rate is directly proportional to specific surface area. [Gullicks and Cleasby, 1986](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25042842.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ad9da82b9b851c3d02a23339cd5f0f45d) found that the mass transfer rate of the biofilm can be increased in two ways: increasing temperature and increasing ammonia concentration. From theses reports the team's earlier assumption the parameters affecting BOD removal are similar to those affecting nitrification is valid.
The team also found another factor that effected nitrification rate which is oxygen availability [(Okey and Albertson 1989)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/25046965). There are two regimes of the nitrogen kinetic equation. When oxygen is limited, it is a zero-order kinetic model with respect to ammonia and half order with respect to oxygen. When oxygen is plentiful, it is a first order model with respect to ammonia. The removal equation found was as:

$\left(NH_{4}-N\right)_{R} = \frac{K_{ao}S_{o}^{0.5}A_{trans}}{Q} + \left(NH_{4}-N\right)_{trans}\left(1-e^{-K_{n}L}\right)$
* $\left(NH_{4}-N\right)_{R} = NH_{4}-N$ concentration removed, $\frac{g}{m^{3}}$
* $S_{o} =$ bulk phase oxygen concentration, $\frac{g}{m^{3}}$
* $K_{ao} =$ constant that contains diffusivity of and stoichiometric requirement for oxygen, $\frac{g^{0.5}d}{m^{0.5}}$
  - $K_{ao,max} = 3.8$
* $A_{trans} =$ Media surface to transition, $m^{2}$
* $Q =$ flow rate, $\frac{m^{3}}{d}$
* $\left(NH_{4}-N\right)_{trans} =$ The $NH_{4}-N$ concentration at the transition from oxygen control to $NH_{4}-N$ control, $\frac{g}{m^{3}}$
* $K_{n} =$ first-order constant, $m^{-1}$
* $L =$ first order depth term, $m$

Therefore compared to the team's improvement based on the BOD kinetic model, an additional parameter is oxygen concentration. Higher oxygen concentrations result in higher removals.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
I understand what you mean but the use of the team's improvement as being changed is a bit confusing. Consider a different way of expressing this.
</div>

#### Ideas for improvements
The team incorporated the need for airflow into their brainstorming of a novel geometry. In developing this novel geometry, the spacing between our media for the biofilm to grow on should be greater than adhesion and cohesion of water particles can withstand. Surface tension in a cylinder can be calculated using the following equation:
$F_{ST} = \pi\lambda D$ where D is the diameter of the cylinder. Surface tension can be looked up in table for different materials, and the minimum diameter needed to overcome it would be when this force balances with gravitational force.

## Design Parameters

### Factors to Consider in Designing Physical Facilities

1. Type and physical characteristics of packing material
2. Dosing rate
3. Dosing characteristics for distribution system
4. Configuration of underdrain system
5. Ventilation through either natural or forced airflow
6. Settling tank designs for the effluent

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
This is fantastic!
</div>

### Packing Media

The ideal packing material for a trickling filter has a high surface area-to-volume ratio. Factors which add to the value of an ideal packing media are its durability, if it is low in cost, and allows for porosity great enough to promote air circulation and to prevent clogging in the system.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Use parallel sentence structures in lists
</div>

Plastic packing, for example, has the advantage over rock-based packing for its ability to operate at higher organic loading rates. Due to the characteristics of the media, the trickling filters can be much taller.

#### Packing Material Properties
| Material |Nominal Size (cm) |Surface Area (m^2/m^3)| Void Space (%) | Application |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |--- | --- |
|  Rock (small)   |   2.5-7.5  |  60   |  50   |  N   |
|  Rock (large)  |  10-13   |   45  |  60   |   C, CN, N  |
|  Plastic -- Conventional   |   61 x 61 x 122  |   90  |  >95   |   C, CN, N  |
|  Plastic -- High Specific Surface Area  |  61 x 61 x 122   |   140  |   >94  |  N   |
|  Plastic random packing - conventional   |  Varies   |   98  |   80  |   C, CN, N  |
|  Plastic random packing - high specific surface area   |  Varies   |   150  |  70   |  N   |
######C = BOD Removal; N = Tertiary Nitrification; CN = Combined BOD and Nitrification

### Dosing Rate

The dosing rate of on a trickling filter is the depth of liquid discharged on top of the packing for each pass of the distributor (Tchobanoglous et. al. 2003, pp 898). To achieve the desired flowrate, plant operators can change a number of control points in the system to do so. Firstly, the locations of some existing orifices can be reversed to the front of the distributor arm. An alternative to this would be to add reversed deflectors to existing orifice discharges. The final, and most energy-intensive alternative to dosing control is to include a variable-speed electric driver to the rotating distributor arm.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Revise to be concise.

What does reversing the location of the existing orifices do? Make the flow rate increase or decrease?
</div>

If a high dosing rate is set in order to maintain a thick biofilm  in the filter media, then the efficacy of treatment may see a sharp decrease in performance due to a reduction in contact time between the water flowing through the system and the packing media. A daily intermittent high-flow dose is applied to the system, known as the "flushing dose". The flushing dose is used to control the thickness of the biofilm and any remaining solids in the system.

</div>

#### Ideas for Improvements

One of the primary failure modes of a trickling filter system involves complications with the mechanized components, especially those in the distribution system. The rotational velocity of the arms is usually driven by hydraulic propulsion, which may not apply the optimal dosing rate due to a lack of sub-metering in the distributor. In other words, the application of water across the media is largely left up to a rough approximation.

As the rotary arms dose water to the system, there is a non-uniform distribution across the filter media. This is an immediate source of efficiency losses since the biofilm can only treat the water in which it comes in contact with. Additionally, the dosing ports in the arms have a tendency to become clogged with miscellaneous debris which may have been missed by the primary clarification process. Most plants do not have sub-metering within the arms to measure the volumetric flow distribution of wastewater being dosed to the system.

An area for improvement is to completely forgo the mechanical distribution system, and to design a reliable distributor which can dose wastewater uniformly across the media. The most valuable modification to the distributor would be the ability to have full control over the dosing rates at any given moment.

#### Natural Draft
The driving force behind natural airflow is derived from a temperature gradient between the ambient air temperature and the temperature within the pores of the media material. An equation from (Schroeder and Tchobanoglous, 1976):

$D_{air} = 353(\frac{1}{T_c} - \frac{1}{T_h})Z$

* $\small D_{air}$ = natural air draft, mm of water
* $\small T_c$ = cold temperature, K
* $\small T_h$ = hot temperature, K
* $\small Z$ = height of filter, m

The trickling filter for the team will strive to employ a naturally aerated system. The industry-standard for natural aeration or "natural draft" is to use a temperature gradient between the filter media and the ambient air temperature to provide a flow of air. To achieve natural draft, the following criteria are required:

1. The drainage and collection channels must not flow any greater than halfway full in order to permit air flow throughout the system.
2. Access ports with adequate openings should be implemented at both tremendous.
3. Open areas of the underdrain blocks (top slots) should be no less than 15% of the overall cross-sectional area of the filter.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

## Case Study: Cayuga Heights Trickling Filter Observations
The team visited the Cayuga Heights wastewater treatment plant and observed a trickling filter first-hand. It was a very informative visit, and the team was dismayed at the state of the plant and the many issues it was experiencing, especially with the trickling filters. There were two trickling filters at the plant, both of which had substantial debris (clumps of organic material, trash) on top of filter (see Figure 2); the plant manager stated that the cause was likely a failure of the bar screen that should have removed such debris when the water initially enters the plant the plant and the inefficiency of the settling tanks, which the wastewater travels through immediately before the trickling filters.

The team also observed that the distribution arms were failing to cover the surface of the filter with water and there was a significant portion of the tank surface that was getting little to no water on it (see Figure 3). The regions that were most noticeably dry were the edges of the tank and an area a couple feet from the center of the base of the distributor arms. There was also a pattern of discoloration on the top of the filter, which seemed to be caused by the substantial organic matter coming through, that suggested that even the portion of the filter’s surface that was getting watered was not getting watered equally, and that there was build up of the organic matter that was getting more water (see Figure 2).

Figure 3: Distribution arms failed to entirely cover the surface of the trickling filter and there was leakage from the base in the center.

There was leakage from the base of the distributor arm on both trickling filters. One had very substantial leakage and a large fraction of the water was just spraying out of the center to only a foot or two away. The plant manager said that the seal connecting the pipe and distributor arm had broken and was going to be replaced. The two filters operating in parallel made it possible for the plant to still operate while under maintenance, but it isn't always true that a system uses two filters, and often plants use recycle flow instead of having multiple filters. The volume of water going through the filter in the area around the base of the distributor arm was very high and the team would expect that the level of treatment for that wastewater is very low, if not non-existent, because of how high the hydraulic loading must be.

The team’s visit to the wastewater treatment plant was very valuable in that it confirmed that the potential issues documented in the literature can be a reality and it made obvious the fact that there is tremendous room for innovation and improvement of trickling filter technology.

## Methods

### Benchtop Experiment

In order to understand the flow patterns in a trickling filter, the team set up a benchtop model to run clean water through. The bench top model was constructed with a 6 inch inner diameter acrylic PVC pipe. As shown in the schematic below.

<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/Trickling-Filter/blob/master/pictures/flow_schematic_front.png?raw=true" height=400 width=250>

Figure 4: This is a schematic of the testing structure. It is an acrylic PVC pipe with holes drills at distances of 5,10,20,40,60, and 80 cm from the top. These holes represent the depths of the filter media that we will be testing. Rods are inserted at the depth of testing to support a mesh which holds the filter media. Water flows from the dosing point through the filter media to the collection unit. The Collection unit is held in place by a PVC pipe.

The PVC pipe could be filled to different heights of gravel to test how flow disperses as a function of depth. the team's hypothesis is that the flow will spread out as depth increases.

Figure 5: This schematic shows the top view of the support structure for the filter media. There is a mesh which is held up by two rods. The rods go through the PVC pipe and are tightened in place by bolts.

Figure 6: this schematic shows the top view of the collection unit for the team's experiments.The squares represent cuvettes which are held in by velcro to a PVC sheet. The amount of water collected in each cuvette is recorded to determine how much water is flowing where.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Do you have actual photos as well of the cuvette collection system.
</div>

This is the collection basin which will be used to map where the water is exiting the model filter. The water will flow in from a dosing point at the top of the filter and if it spreads out as it travels down the system it will flow into many different cuvettes. This can be then used to create heat map, or more accurately a flow map, to determine what areas are being utilized.

After a few experiments, the team found that water was dripping only from the rods and down the side of the PVC. Therefore they removed the rods and balanced the mesh on top of the collection basin.

The procedure for a test was to first wet the surface of the rocks. This meant flowing water through at a high rate and not draining the bottom until the entire column was wet. Then the water was drained to gravity potential in a soil. Once the gravel  wetted, a short pulse of 100 mL of water was added. For cuvettes that had water in them, the depth of water in millimeters was measured by inserted a marked straw. However, in many of the preliminary tests until the correct amount of water was determined the cuvettes overflowed and the data was compromised. For tests where the water overflowed, the team still recorded whether a cuvette had been "hit", i.e. had water in it.

The team also varied the packing material being tested to marbles. The team choose marbles because they are only slightly larger than the pea gravel, but are uniform in size.

The benchtop experiment for the team is still under development, however, the means with which the experiment will be conducted is backed through verbal and written consensus within the team. The primary objective of the team's first experiment is to gather a hydraulic model for the preferential flow tendencies within the filter media. It is hypothesized that much of the porosity in the filter media is unutilized, and will remain dry due to flaws in the distribution system as well as the geometric structure of the filter.

What is the purpose of the first sentence?

How do you "gather a hydraulic model," do you mean gather data for a hydraulic model?

</div>

Water will be dispensed by pipetting a designated volume into the media at a specified point at the surface of the filter. This point will be marked off by drilling and annotating holes on a cap covering the entry point of the filter. The distribution of water will vary both across the distribution grid and by varying the depth of gravel. After a trial is conducted, a collection module of cuvettes will be weight in order to capture the exit point of the water under a given distribution and media depth.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Will you be varying the distribution of water? Or do you mean that it was vary based on where you put it?

Hydraulic fingering through the media will be represented through a three-dimensional heat map. This experiment can be characterized by the underlying principal of a CAT-scan: the data will provide insight into the cross sectional behavior within the trickling filter media which has not been greatly understood in literature. As more data is collected across varying points in the horizontal plane from the entry grid, and then in the vertical plane by adding or subtracting gravel (packing material), a more robust representation of the hydraulic behavior can be characterized; this level of detail depends on the granularity of the trials and the level of consistency between them.

## Results and Analysis

In the teams first test, we ran the pulse of water from the center of the column through the 5 cm rock depth. The team's hypothesis is that since this was such a thin layer, the water would exit nearly exactly where it can in. The team actually observed that almost all the water ended up on the walls of the apparatuses and only 4 cuvettes had water in. There could be multiple reasons for this results. 1. Since the rocks are multiple sizes they fit together in a such a way that the water would prefer to flow sideways instead of down. Then when the water came in contact with the wall it became attached and never came unattached. 2. The water hit the mesh at the bottom of the apparatus and it was angled so that water flowed to the edges on the mesh before falling into the collection basin. The team conducted this test multiple times at multiple depths to reveal the same results. The next step is to try marbles because that will determine whether or not it is the mesh or the rocks. Since the marbles are a consistent size, they can't be an almost solid layer.

## Conclusion

In the team’s initial research, extensive information has been gathered on the operational difficulties, the kinetics, and typical design parameters of trickling filters. Many of the issues plant operators encounter with trickling filters, like clogging and ponding, lack of moisture in parts of the filter, and generally inefficiency of the filter can be addressed by improving two aspects of the filter: the filter media itself and the distribution system. The BOD kinetic model also supports improving the filter media to increase the specific surface area, using alternative materials instead of the traditional rocks or gravel. The team’s research on nitrogen kinetics adds a need for proper aeration of the filter to the list of considerations when designing a new filter media.

The lack of available information and limited research on some aspects of the kinetic model, $k_{20}$ values for example, motivate the team to potentially do lab tests and calculate $k_{20}$ values for various media and try to find a more standardized model than what is found in the existing literature. Similarly, the team is working on a test to address the assumption made by the current kinetic model that the entire volume of the filter is being used by looking at the flow distribution.

Preliminary research was driven primarily by industry research, however, it is expected than many of the established parameters will be subject to change as a result of independent research efforts. The findings of the team's experiments will be intended to characterize a trickling filter system absent of mechanical components and with higher filter media utilization. By the conclusion of this team's work, a vast majority of the gaps in literature will be filled with conclusive empirical data to serve as a model for wastewater plants in resource-scarce locations in addition to modifying the faults in industry around the world.

In the past few weeks, the team has been fabricating the bench top model and beginning to conduct  tests to determine the distribution of flow in trickling filters. The preliminary results from these tests were confusing, as almost all water was running down the side of the tube instead of through the media, so the process of getting data has been slower than the team was expecting. In an attempt to address this issue and pin point what exactly is causing this, the team has started testing with marbles as a trickling media to see if similar behavior is observed with various media if it is specific to the pea gravel.

## Future Work
The team has just started with testing flow patterns and will continue to conduct tests and work on a model for the preferential flow tendencies, with both the pea gravel and the new filter media of marbles. In addition to flow mapping, the team will also work on brainstorming and designing novel geometries for testing. This will include building models of the team's current ideas. Along with the testing, the team is frequently thinking about what novel designs could address any of the various areas for improvement in the discovered during research. The team expects to have a solid start on an elementary model of an entirely different trickling filter system using strings by the end of the semester, as well as a more solid set of data from the flow tests. A future goal that will not be attempted this semester is the creation of a bench top model  that allows for measurement of nitrogen and phosphorus removal.
