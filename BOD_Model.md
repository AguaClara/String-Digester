## A kinetics model for trickling Filters and how to improve performance

The trickling filter will be used as the second treatment in series with a UASB reactor. The assumptions of the trickling filter team is that the majority of BOD will be removed by the UASB reactor. Therefore the trickling filter will be mostly removing nutrients (i.e. Nitrogen and Phosphorus). the team could not find any literature on a kinetic model for the removal of nitrogen or phosphorus. Therefore, we are using a BOD kinetic model with the assumption that nutrient removal would be proportional to BOD removal. The most common kinetic model for trickling filters is the modified Velz Equation.

The modified Velz Equation from Logan et. al. 1987:

$C_{out} =\frac{C_{in}}{(R+1)e^{\frac{k_{20}A_{s}H\theta^{T-20}}{Q_{i}(R+1)^{n}}}- R}$

Where:
* $C_{out}=$ The $BOD_{5}$ leaving the filter
* $C_{in}=$ The $BOD_{5}$ entering the filter
* $R=$  The recycle ratio defined as the ratio of recirculation flow to the plant influent flow
* $k_{20}=$ The kinetic constant/treatability coefficient
* $A_{s}=$ The specific surface area
* $H=$ The filter height
* $\theta=$ an empirical correction factor typically set equal to 1.035
* $T=$ Temperature in degrees C
* $Q_{i}=$ The flow before recycle divided by filter cross sectional area

The team's preliminary design for the filter would not include any recycle, therefore the equation simplifies to:

$C_{out} ={C_{in}}{e^{\frac{-k_{20}A_{s}H\theta^{T-20}}{Q_{i}^{n}}}}$

The main points of improvement based on the kinetic model would be to increase the height/depth of the filter, increase the surface area, increase temperature, or increase the $k_{20}$ value.

### Increasing Temperature
The teams assumption is that the wastewater treatment plants would be built outside without heating or air conditioning. Separately using an anaerobic digester to digest sludge and heat the filter would be an option that future teams could look into.

### Increasing Height/Depth of filter
This is an area that could improve the performance of the trickling filter. The team is looking for a novel design that can make traditional filters more cost-effective. The team does not believe that there is a lot of room for improvement in just changing the height of the filter.

### Increasing the specific surface area
Specific surface area is surface area per volume. In order to change the specific surface area of the filter the packing material must be changed. To increase specific surface area, the packing material must have more surface area for the same amount of volume. In many trickling filters in Honduras, the packing material is gravel or rocks. This leaves a lot of room for improvement of surface area. In the US, there has been a lot of research and development of new higher specific surface area packing materials. Many of these materials are very expensive and would not fit with AguaClara low-cost model. From these materials though the team can learn what properties improve filter performance and mimic them in a more cost effective material.

### Flow Distributions
An assumption of this model is that the entire volume of the trickling filter is being used. The team would also like to research whether this assumption is valid. The team believes that there may be unused volume fo the trickling filter that is not getting any flow because the water takes another path with less resistance. Therefore the team also conducted experiments to determine how flow is distributed. After these tests, the team determined how to use a packing material and filter design that utilizes all of the available space.
