## Abstract

The string digester teamâ€™s objective for this semester is to continue research on designing a new wastewater treatment system to eliminate problems associated with current trickling filters by using strings to optimize surface area and improve consistency in wastewater treatment. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater when implemented in an AguaClara treatment plant. Initial tests involving string material, biofilm growth, and string spacing will help define design parameters for the construction of a functioning string digester.

## Introduction

The String Digester, formerly Trickling Filter, sub-team originated in the Spring of 2018 due to the remaining need for continued wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. Nutrient pollution still remains in wastewater of Honduras, thus the trickling filter wastewater treatment can be pivotal in minimizing, if not eliminating, the unwanted organic matter. Seeking to augment industrial-scale trickling filters, work from the previous semester identified an issue with the process: a large amount of unused space is found within almost all units due to preferential flow of wastewater. That being said, the primary objective is to continue to discover, construct, and tweak methods that can maximize the efficiency of trickling filter wastewater treatment. After coming to the idea that strings may be a good replacement as the media in these units, this semester will focus on boosting the amount of used volume within the trickling filter by examining different materials of strings as well as the placement of this form of media on a filter. With this work, the team will work towards assessing the feasibility of the implementation of a trickling filter unit in future AguaClara treatment plants.

Research dealing with trickling filter wastewater treatment was ubiquitous in the 1970's and 1980's, however the method of treatment faced a lack of research in the following decades. Research on wastewater treatment shift more towards processes that were more active and higher in energy consumption. A notable feature of the trickling filter wastewater treatment is the low-energy requirements to run the reactor. This feature of this type of treatment is the driving force in the investigation of trickling filter research for AguaClara. This method of treatment has the potential to align with the mission of achieving hydraulically-driven systems which will be much more feasible in areas of the world in which capital expenditure is a major barrier for employing this technology.

With this, the team believes that there can be a large amount of progress that can be made by testing different materials for the new media, strings and constructing different designs for the placement of the strings. Research in these two areas can contribute towards designing a industrial-scale trickling filter system that is not only financially sustainable enough to be run in the low-resource country of Honduras, but is most efficient in use of treating wastewater. The String Digester sub-team strives to make significant technological improvements on industry-standard applications for the system.

##Previous work
In the first semester as a sub-team, the Trickling Filter team spent a substantial amount of time doing research and gathered information on the operational difficulties, the kinetics, and typical design parameters of trickling filters. The team aimed to address the many of the issues plant operators encounter with trickling filters, like clogging and ponding, lack of moisture in parts of the filter, and generally inefficiency of the filter. The two main aspects of improvement the team identified were the filter media itself and the distribution system.

The team fabricated the bench top model for flow mapping and conducted several rounds of tests to determine the distribution of flow in trickling filters with small rock and marble media. From this experiment, the team found that there is substantial volume of a trickling filter left unused and essentially wasted space due to preferential flow. believes that a uniform packing material is better than a random material. In an effort to both maximize the surface area to volume ratio and to minimize the footprint of the system by not wasting space, the team decided to turn to strings as a possible filter media. This concept lead the team to start with very preliminary testing of a system that was essentially an overflowing basin with strings coming out the sides. In these initial tests the team members observed that the water overflowing does in fact follow the strings down. From these observations, the String Digester team will now begin more rigorous testing on the concept and investigate whether using strings in a wastewater treatment system is truly viable.



## Literature Review
There is significant documentation of problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. Some of the issues, while important to take into consideration when implementing trickling filters, may not offer much room in terms of what improvements the team can make. Such problems include: the development of slug populations in the trickling filters, which can remove the layer of biofilm and harm the nitrifying bacteria population, thereby negatively impacting the systems performance and plug the channels of the system; filter flies, whose presence suggests a lack of moisture throughout the filter; and foul odors, which can indicate an increasing level of anaerobic reactions or accumulating sloughed-off biomass in the filter media. Addressing pest-control issues is not a priority for the team at this time, as there are greater improvements to be made elsewhere.

Some of these previously mentioned problems (insect and slug presence in filters) as well as high biomass sloughing rate contribute to clogging and ponding in filters. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims avoid the problem altogether by using strings and not having a media that can clog up. It is still an important factor to consider in the design because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system will likely clog up with biofilm growth.

There can be issues with variations in temperature: biofilm thickness changes seasonally and can be low quality and uneven in cold temperatures. In freezing weather, formation of ice can cause clogging and structural damage to the trickling media. These are generally not major concerns for plants in equatorial regions, and so while important to note, will not be a focus for the team at this point.

 Ali et al. states that the most common problem in trickling filters is uncontrolled sloughing, which is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates. This can be particularly problematic after storm events when flooding results in very high hydraulic loading. It can also be caused by clogging of the distribution arm and uneven distribution of the influent [(Ali et al. 2017).](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf) There is potential for the development of a much-improved distribution system that could help to alleviate this problem.

 Proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of distribution is rotating distributors, but this system will not serve the string-focused design, so the team will eventually need to pursue a new distribution method, that would hopefully require less maintenance and be less prone to failure.

The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system, utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the medium, spaced to give uniform distribution of water. Because this method is not rotating, it may be more applicable to the string media They generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. They are more commonly used with intermittent dosing, so flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters).


Unfortunately, these systems are also prone to clogging or blockage issues and similarly challenged by inconsistency of hydraulic load on the surface of the trickling filter. This is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.
