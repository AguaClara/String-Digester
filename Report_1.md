# Template Description
This template will lay out all possible sections that could be used for a research report and manual. All research reports and manuals should strive to comply with this template, but every team will use different parts. In order to use this template, copy this file from the AguaClara team resources repository to your team's repository, and rename it for your team in a format similar to  "[Team Name] [Semester]". An example would be "Filter and Treatment Train Flow Control Spring 2017." For additional information on all the possibilities in markdown files, refer to the AguaClara Interactive Tutorial and the AguaClara Tutorial training pages. After you complete that step, please delete this description and everything above this.

## Abstract
Briefly summarize your previous work, goals and objectives, what you have accomplished, and future work. (100 words max)

The string digester team’s objective for this semester is to continue research on designing a new system to eliminate problems associated with current trickling filters by using strings to optimize surface area and improve consistency in wastewater treatment. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater when implemented in an AguaClara treatment plant. Initial tests involving string material, biofilm growth, and string spacing will help define design parameters for the construction of a functioning string digester. 

## Introduction
Explain how the completion of your challenge will affect AguaClara and the mission of providing safe drinking water (or sustainable wastewater treatment!). If this is a continuing team, how will your contribution build upon previous research? What needs to be further discovered or defined? If this is a new team, what prompted the inclusion of this team?

The String Digester, formerly Trickling Filter, sub-team originated in the Spring of 2018 due to the remaining need for continued wastewater treatment even after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. Nutrient pollution still remains in wastewater of Honduras, thus the trickling filter wastewater treatment can be pivotal in minimizing, if not eliminating, the unwanted organic matter. Seeking to augment industrial-scale trickling filters, work from the previous semester identified an issue with the process: a large amount of unused space is found within almost all units due to preferential flow of wastewater. That being said, the primary objective is to continue to discover, construct, and tweak methods that can maximize the efficiency of trickling filter wastewater treatment. After coming to the idea that strings may be a good replacement as the media in these units, this semester will focus on boosting the amount of used volume within the trickling filter by examining different materials of strings as well as the placement of this form of media on a filter. With this work, the team will work towards assessing the feasibility of the implementation of a trickling filter unit in future AguaClara treatment plants. 
 
Research dealing with trickling filter wastewater treatment was ubiquitous in the 1970's and 1980's, however the method of treatment faced a lack of research in the following decades. Research on wastewater treatment shift more towards processes that were more active and higher in energy consumption. A notable feature of the trickling filter wastewater treatment is the low-energy requirements to run the reactor. This feature of this type of treatment is the driving force in the investigation of trickling filter research—this method of treatment has the potential to align with the mission of achieving hydraulically-driven systems which will be much more feasible in areas of the world in which capital expenditure is a major barrier for employing this technology.
With this, the team believes that there can be a large amount of progress that can be made by testing different materials for the new media, strings and constructing different designs for the placement of the strings. Research in these two areas can contribute towards designing a industrial-scale trickling filter system that is not only financially sustainable enough to be run in the low-resource country of Honduras, but is most efficient in use of treating wastewater. The String Digester sub-team strives to make significant technological improvements on industry-standard applications for the system.

## Literature Review and Previous Work
Discuss what is already known about your research area based on both external work and that of past AguaClara Teams. Connect your objectives with what is already known and explain what additional contribution you intend to make. Make sure to add APA formatted in-text citations. If you mention the author(s) in your sentence, you can simply give the year of publication.[(Logan et. al. 1987)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true)
