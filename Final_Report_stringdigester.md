## Abstract
The string digester teamâ€™s objective for the Fall 2018 semester was to continue research on designing a new wastewater treatment system to eliminate problems associated with current trickling filters. To improve consistency in wastewater treatment, experiments were conducted using strings to optimize surface area. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater. Initial tests involving different string materials, biofilm growth, and string spacing helped define design parameters for the construction of a functioning string digester.

## Introduction
The String Digester sub-team was created in response to the remaining need for secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. Looking to improve on the traditional industrial-scale trickling filter design, previous work identified an issue with the process: there is a substantial amount of unused space in almost all treatment units due to preferential flow of wastewater. The primary objective of this sub-team is to continue to develop a novel design for a highly efficient trickling filter with a minimized footprint. Following the conclusion from Spring 2018 that strings would be a viable trickling media, the team decided to focus this semester's research on trying to determine what strings would work the best and whether the current concept is still valid. With this work, the team will work towards assessing the feasibility of a modified trickling filter unit in future AguaClara treatment plants while striving to make significant technological improvements on industry-standard applications for the system.

Research dealing with trickling filter wastewater treatment was ubiquitous in the 1970's and 1980's, however, research on this method of treatment significantly decreased in following decades. Research on secondary wastewater treatment, performed by trickling filters previously, shifted more towards processes higher in energy consumption. Because of AguaClara's mission and the regions a future wastewater plant would serve, trickling filters are a promising technology due to their low-energy requirements. Maintaining will be a priority in the team's future design. With modification, the trickling filter treatment system carries much potential to be implemented in areas of the world in which capital expenditure is a major barrier for employing traditional secondary wastewater treatment (aeration tanks).

## Previous work
### Spring 2018
In Spring 2018, the Trickling Filter team spent a substantial amount of time doing research and gathering information on the operational difficulties, the kinetics, and typical design parameters of trickling filters. The team aimed to address many of the issues plant operators encounter with trickling filters, like clogging and ponding, lack of moisture in parts of the filter, and general inefficiency of the filter. The two main areas for improvement the team identified were the filter media itself and the distribution system.

The team fabricated a bench top model for flow mapping and conducted several rounds of tests to determine the distribution of flow in trickling filters with small rock and marble media. From these experiments, the team noticed that there were significant portions of the media that never got wet and thus concluded that a substantial volume of the trickling filter was unused due to preferential flow. From these tests the team also showed that a uniform packing material is superior to an irregularly shaped material. In an effort to both maximize the surface area to volume ratio and to minimize the footprint of the system by not wasting space, the team shifted focus towards strings as a possible filter media. This concept led the team to start with very preliminary testing of a system that was essentially an overflowing basin with strings submerged at the top, inside the basin, and draped over the sides to guide water down to a collection bucket below. [**ZC: A reference to the later figures you have would be helpful. It would not be clear to me what this looks like without having seen it**]In these initial tests, the team members observed that the water did in fact follow the along strings when it overflowed. From these observations, the String Digester team began to design more rigorous tests on the concept and planned to investigate whether using strings in a wastewater treatment system is truly viable.

## Literature Review
### Trickling Filters
The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and preferential flow occurs. Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused. This leads to a less efficient treatment of organic matter than if all of the space in the filter were utilized. In their paper, Spuhler recommends using specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation & allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018).](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215)

In addition to non-homogenous distribution of wastewater throughout the filter, there is significant documentation of other problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. Ali and co-authors state that one major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not addressed, the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims avoid the problem altogether by using strings and not having a media that can clog up. It is still an important factor to consider in the design because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system will likely clog up with biofilm growth.

Ali also states that the aforementioned sloughing and clogging is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Uneven HLR is caused by clogging of the distribution arm and an uneven distribution of influent. Therefore, proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of influent distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors consist of moving parts that require more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. Additionally, this system will not serve the string-focused design.

The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system, utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the medium and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a string media. However, Sperling and colleagues showed that both the fixed and rotating distribution systems have an inconsistent hydraulic load of the influent [(Sperling 2007)](https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402123.pdf). Therefore, the distribution system is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.


Although there are multiple problems with trickling filters, one main advantage of trickling filters is that they have a relatively low residence time. This is a consideration which the team should plan to maintain in future designs. Hinton and Stensel measured residence time per unit length of between 30 and 40 sec/m with dye tests. Their predicted residence times, calculated from laminar flow theory, were closer to about 15 sec/m. The authors attributed this discretion to "dye sorption and desorption by the biofilm." In either case, the residence time for a 5 meter deep trickling filter would be well under 5 minutes [(Hinton and Stensel 1991)](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135491901179/1-s2.0-0043135491901179-main.pdf?_tid=e8d2db22-8e0f-4d3c-a421-352ef74e6f5e&acdnat=1540500088_4808114af12660c061fbd139ac0fbd33). This short treatment time makes trickling filters an appealing wastewater treatment option if problems such as uneven HLR and clogging can be minimized.

### Trickling Filter Alternatives
Downward Hanging Sponge (DHS) Reactors are another form of treating wastewater. They have a similar mechanism as trickling filters. Water is distributed onto sponges and water trickles down through and on the sponges due to gravity. Biofilm grows within and on the sponge and removes organic nutrients from the wastewater as it trickles down. Onodera and co-authors [**ZC: Onodero, et al. (2013) - hyperlink as well**]found the advantages of DHS include: high biomass concentration, high sludge residence time, low hydraulic retention time, small footprint. There are six generations of the DHS reactor. The different generations are different sizes and geometries of sponges including sponge cubes, curtain long triangular sponge strips on a plastic sheet, sponge packing unit in net-like plastic, and the most recent generation: a rigid sponge from a mix of polyurethane and epoxy resin. Polyurethane was shown to support microorganism growth and retain water [(Onodera 2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24291312). In addition, the high porosity of the sponge enhances diffusion of air into the wastewater, and maintains an dissolved oxygen at level higher than necessary for aerobes. This way, no extra aeration is necessary for the system compared to traditional aerobic treatment systems [(M. Tandukar et al., 2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16180445).

DHS reactors are an appealing alternative to traditional trickling filters as they overcome some problems. One problem DHS overcomes is a low sludge residence time. This is because micro-organisms can grow both inside and on the surface of the sponge. This also optimizes the space. The DHS was also shown to have lower excess sludge than the traditional trickling filter. Onodera and co-authors showed that DHS reactors are a viable secondary treatment post USAB and that sponges have much potential in treating wastewater [(Onodera 2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24291312).  

### Biofilm
A component of the string digester that is crucial to its success is the biofilm. "A biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells that is irreversibly associated (not removed by gentle rinsing) with a surface and enclosed in a matrix of primarily polysaccharide material." [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) Biofilm attachment is a complex process regulated by diverse characteristics of the growth medium, substratum, and cell surface. Biofilm on trickling filters are composed of a variety of organisms and are typically enclosed in a polysaccharide. The biofilm matrix may also contain mineral crystals, corrosion particles, and clay or silt particles. Biofilms in wastewater systems are often highly complex [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)

Some testing has been done of the growth of biofilm in different surfaces. One study compared growth on glossy electro-polished, bright annealed stainless steel to matte stainless steel and to PVC. The paper notes that stainless steel is hydrophilic and PVC is hydrophobic. In the last 45 days of the 167 day experiment, the matte steel had about 1.44 times more microorganisms than the electro-polished steel, and there was no significant difference between the PVC and polished steel. In discussion of why this occurs, Pedersen cites two reasons: "detachment due to shear forces from the flow will be reduced on the rougher surface since cells can be shielded from the bulk flow and more substratum surface area may be available for the biofilm" [(Pedersen 1990).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)


# Methods

## 1. Filter Media: Strings
The team decided to start with buying a selection of strings to test as possible filter media in a string digester. The strings were selected based on their ability to withstand a wastewater treatment system. The scope of the potential materials for strings was narrowed to non-biodegradable materials due to the team's realization that biodegradable strings would not be durable in a system that continuously covered them in wastewater and would not be able to support the necessary biofilm without degrading. Metal alloys and polymer-based materials were the most accessible materials to obtain, so it was decided to obtain equal amount of strings in each. The structure and diameter of the strings was differentiated in each material group due to the notion that surface texture and/or diameter of the strings could have an effect on water flow and the team's desire to test this effect.

In this report, the following strings will be referred to by the following names: the polypropylene twine will be referred to as "twine", the nylon monofilament string will be referred to as "nylon string", the stainless steel wire will be referred to as "wire", and the stainless steel cable will be referred to as "cable".

For experiments 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 the same set of strings were used, see Strings section in the Manual for detailed descriptions and pictures.

### 1.1 Mass of Water Experiment

#### 1.1.1 Objective of Experiment
The objective of the initial experiment was to determine the amount of water that could be held on different types of string and make connections between specific properties of the strings, like surface area or texture, and how much water they can hold at one time.

#### 1.1.2 Experimental Apparatus
A scale was secured approximately one meter above a lab bench resting on supports at each corner so the bottom of the scale was left open. There is a hook on the bottom of the scale that measures the weight that is hung from the hook. A single string was attached to the hook on the bottom of the scale and allowed to hang down freely, see Figure 1 below.

</center>

#### 1.1.3 Procedure
A narrow tube was connected to a peristaltic pump and water was pumped at a known rate. The end of the tube was directed onto the top of the string hanging from the scale, in an attempt to allow water to flow onto and down the hanging string. The scale was zeroed before the experiment started so the scale would just measure the weight of the water on the string. The idea was to get water flowing on the string and then, while continuously pumping water onto the string, measure the weight of the water on the string at a moment in time. From this measurement, the team would be able to quantify how much water a particular string could hold per unit length.

#### 1.1.4 Results and Analysis
The method of directing the water onto the string did not work. The team tried several angles and techniques to try to get the water from the tube to connect and travel down the string but were unsuccessful. Water spiraled off the string upon immediate contact and was not able to trickle down the hanging string. Therefore, taking weight measurements was not possible or useful, as the expected sheath of water on the string did not form. This experiment was tested with twine and wire, and then abandoned due to lack of success.

[**Was this attempted for all the string types? It's hard to tell**]

The failure of this test prompted the team to question whether the water would flow on the strings at all, as the team in the previous semester (Spring 2018) had been able to observe with yarn/cotton based string. Because of this question of whether the new types of strings would work at all, the team decided to return to the experiment conducted by the Spring 2018 team and see if the current team could recreate the success of the previous semester, where they had seen the string prototype perform well and the strings hold water as expected.

### 1.2 Overflowing Basin Experiment

#### 1.2.1 Objective of Experiment
The objective of this experiment was to see if the water would run down the new non-biodegradable strings using the basin distribution system from Spring 2018 or if all the new strings were unable to hold water.

#### 1.2.2 Experimental Apparatus
The experiment from last semester was recreated using the non-biodegradable strings as media, rather than the cotton yarn. A basin was filled with water and attached at an elevated surface about one meter above the lab bench. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, strings were then wrapped tightly around the top of the basin and at a metal rod below the basin. The strings were set up so they were evenly spaced and perpendicular to the ground. The amount of a string wrapped on the apparatus were spaced somewhat uniformly, limited by the length of string available. The team believes spacing is important for maximizing a system's treatment capacity but spacing was not tested in these experiments and therefore keep as consistent as possible.

#### 1.2.3 Procedure
String was wrapped around the dispenser and around a bottom pole in one long strand and pulled taught. The basin was filled with water using the peristaltic pump to induce overflow. As the water overflows the basin, the team observed whether or not the overflowing water followed a path down the string as desired.

#### 1.2.4 Results and Analysis

Figure 4. Strings on the set-up in the following material from left to right: wire, unrolled twine, nylon string, and twine.

The water did not flow along any of the materials. It mostly avoided the strings and flowed over the side of the basin at the top, falling freely through the air instead of attaching to a string. In addition, the water that did get onto the materials formed droplets and did not travel down string in a constant flow (see Figure 4). The minimal water that did attach to the strings initially spiraled off part way down. The cable was hard to experiment on as it didn't conform to the sharp edges of the basin and did not make good contact with the water.

From these results, the team confirmed the concern that these strings were not inclined to carry water the way the cotton yarn had in Spring 2018 experiments. This failure suggested to the team that the material of the strings might be hydrophilic, or at least water adverse in the sense that they were unwilling to carry water. The team was not yet ready to abandon the idea of using the purchased strings altogether, so an effort was made to modify the system to make the string more favorable for the overflowing water.

### 1.3 Modified Overflowing Basin Experiment

#### 1.3.1 Objective of Experiment
The team objective of the next set of experiments was to see if the team could use a modified design of the system to "encourage" the water to attach to and better follow along the string. The team wanted to observe whether a gradual slope would help the water flow down onto the strings rather then straight down off the sides of the basin.

#### 1.3.2 Experimental Apparatus
Because the water was avoiding the strings, the team modified the experimental apparatus to give the water more time and a gentler slope to flow onto the string. This was achieved by attaching two plastic arcs, or "wings", which were quarters of a PVC pipe cut to the dimensions of the basin. The arcs were glued onto the sides of the basin so that the basin had downward sloping sides (see Figures 5 and 6). To ensure the basin was watertight, glue was applied to all the seams. To keep the strings vertical when wrapped around the setup, a flat rectangle of acrylic was taped to the bar at bottom of the setup (see Figure 7).

The rest of the setup was the same as in the previous experiment (see section 1.2.2 for more information). Additionally, because the cable was lubricated, the team washed it with soap and water before testing in hopes that this would make it less hydrophobic.

#### 1.3.3 Procedure
This experiment was run in the same way as previous experiment, see section 1.2.3 for more information.

</center>

Despite introducing a gradual slope for the water to flow down, the results of this experiment were similar to the results from the previous overflowing basin experiment. The strings were still hydrophobic so the water avoided flowing down the strings even when on the curved plastic. If the water did flow along the string on the plastic, droplets began to fall off the strings once they left the plastic at the top. The only string to exhibit slight potential was the cable. Water seemed to initially flow down the cable, following the spiral texture. However, the water would lose the flow quickly after contact with the cable. The water overflowing from the basin was irregular for all materials and the minimal flow exhibited was often flowed over the curved material and in paths between the strings.

The lack of consistent or promising results prompted the team to look at new materials to see if different media would be better suited to use in the string digester.


### 2. Filter Media: Chains and Foam
Following the results of the previous experiments, the scope of what materials of string to use in this set of experiments was further narrowed to hydrophilic, non-biodegradable strings. The polymer-based strings were scrapped as they exhibited no hydrophilic property in the set of experiments, so it was decided to switch over from monofilaments, to a more porous material. Thus, the team decided to look into polymer-based foams, as they would most likely exhibit hydrophilic properties and retain the non-biodegradability. Furthermore, the metal-alloy based strings appeared as if they could work in previous experiments but were inhibited by the lubricant and a lack of texture. The team concluded that using a chain instead of a smooth wire could provide the texture needed to hold water on the string. The team decided to purchase chains that were unfinished to in an attempt to ensure there was no lubricant on the chain. Finally, the structure and diameter of the strings was differentiated in each material group due to the notion that surface texture and/or diameter of the strings could have a strong effect on water flow.

The polymer-based foams will be referred to as the following: the grey polyethylene cord will be referred to as "grey foam", the teal polyurethane foam will be referred to as "teal foam", the white polyurethane foam will be referred to as "white foam", and the blue polyurethane foam will be referred to as "blue foam".

In this report, the metal-alloy based strings will be referred to as the following: the size-35 sash chain will be referred to as "big sash chain", the size-12 sash chain will be referred to as "small sash chain", the size-18 jack chain will be referred to as "jack chain", and the size-3 bead chain cable will be referred to as "bead chain".

See Chains and Foam sections in the Manual for detailed descriptions and pictures of each material.

### 2.1 Overflowing Basin Experiment with new materials

#### 2.1.1 Objective of Experiment
The team objective on this set of experiments was to further experiment with metal-alloy based chains and foam, and to determine if they could be feasible as a string medium. The team wanted to try lots of materials to see if there were any successes, and so preformed numerous experiments.

#### 2.1.2 Experimental Apparatus
To get a broad sense of the feasibility of the new materials as string media, this experiment featured each string being put through several tests with slightly different basins. Using a new set of strings, the first test was done with the experimental setup described in the experiment 1.2, the original overflowing basin experiment. The second test was done using the experimental setup described in the modified overflowing basin experiment, 1.3. The third test was newly created, and involved using a newly fabricated basin that was half the size of the original basin used in experiment 1.2; in this case, the basin was 1.5 inches in length.  The remaining setup for these tests were the same as in the previous two experiments, see section 1.2.3 for more information. Not every material was tested in each basin, because some were more well suited to certain basins based on physical parameters like the length or width of the string. The team experimented with different flow rates and observed how water flowed or did not flow down the various strings.

#### 2.1.3 Procedure
Procedure for these tests were similar to that of the Overflowing Basin Experiment, see section 1.2.3. All eight of the aforementioned materials were tested in this similar fashion for each test differentiating in basin type at varying pumping rates. Size 16 tubing was used to dispense water into three basins of different widths (1.750in, 3.750in, and 4.500in) and the chains were setup with spacing of 5-10mm between each strand. To observe the effects of different flow rates, three different pump speeds (25, 50, and 80 rpm) were tested with each chain and basin combination. The 4.500in winged basin was tested in two ways, with a narrow base and with a widened base, to test the effects of angled strings.


#### 2.1.4 Results and Analysis
For the set of tests for the stainless steel chains, the team documented the observations made during each test with the various chains. Refer to Appendix 1 for an extensive table of the team's observations. Table 2 below gives a brief summary of all the tests.

Based on these initial tests, the bead chain on the the 3.750 inch basin and the jack chain on the 4.500in winged basin had the most promising results. At multiple speeds, these two setups resulted in the highest number of strands with consistent flow and the team was able to observe water  filling the gaps in the chains; the water filled the holes in the jack chain and filled the gaps between the beads on the bead chain. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using chains as strands in a string digester. Further tests with these chains, possibly varying in thickness, length, and pump speed would be helpful in determining an optimal setup to treat water.

For the polymer-based foams, the foams were not tested on each of the apparatuses in this experiment due to the lack of needed length. Aside from the grey foam, each of the foams had to be physically altered into a string, and upon doing so, it left the team with little length to work with. Thus, the foams were used on the testing apparatus that allowed for a feasible amount of wrapping with good spacing in between so that valid data could be collected.

</center>

Based on the data collected, it is clear that the blue foam worked best out of the foams purchased. The blue foam required no manipulation such as pre-wetting, and were able to retain a large amount of water. The teal and white foam also worked well, but needed some sort of manipulation such as pre-wetting to better the water flow. Furthermore, the grey foam did not work at all, as no water was able to flow down the strings. The grey foam is also the only closed-cell constructed foam, thus making the foam moisture resistant. Knowing this beforehand, the results of the grey foam were somewhat expected.

Looking at the data for foams, it shows that foams could be a feasible media for the string. Besides the grey foam, the foams seemed to retain water easily, and there was little to no water flowing on the outside of the foams. The blue foam seemed to be the most promising, as it was easy to work with after physical altercation into strings. The foam was exhibiting similar results at various pumping speeds, thus minimizing the weight of how pumping speed can affect water flow on the strings.

Furthermore, the open-cell construction foams exhibited better results than the closed-cell construction foam. The closed-cell construction foam built water tension on the basin, and was not able to carry the water as desired. Based on the data collected, the idea of using closed-cell construction foams as string media could be ruled out, and research on open-cell construction foams should be furthered.


## Conclusions
The team at first experienced difficulties finding a material for the strings that is both non-biodegradable and will allow the wastewater to stay on the string as it falls over the side of the basin instead of coming off and just falling freely. Experimentation showed that the plastic polymer based string options will not work as a filter media unless somehow altered to make them hydrophilic. The stainless steel based strings show more potential but still seem to require some modifications to the design before they will work with any consistency. The foams and chains show promise as potential materials for a string digester. These materials were able to retain water as it trickled down. The blue foam worked exceptionally well as it absorbed water. The initial testing done on these materials suggests they could work in the proposed system and make the string digester technology possible.

Creating a rapid but efficient string digester would be impactful for the future of AguaClara's involvement in wastewater treatment. String digesters have the potential to greatly decrease the wastewater processing time and also decrease the organic solutes in the effluent. By maximizing potential surface area for the microbes to grow on using strings and sponges, thereby allowing for more microbial digestion of the water, some traditional trickling filter problems would be solved or minimized. Effluent from the UASB will require further treatment and the team believes that a string digester could provide the necessary treatment with minimal energy requirements.


## Future Work

Moving forward, the team should do more rigorous testing on the more promising materials in order to identify properties that best serve the proposed system. In future semesters, after identifying the most feasible materials, the team should focus more on research in the biofilm and wastewater areas using the chosen materials. Specifically, will the selected materials support microbial growth to a degree that the desired level of treatment may be reached? Do the strings allow for growth of all the required types of biofilm, do anaerobic and aerobic zones exist? These are some guiding questions that should be answered in future research. Another aspect of the project that should be further developed and explored is the dispensing system, which the team has not attempted to optimize or improve as of yet.

The team sees a future for the string digester sub-team, in that there is potential in the current design, but much more research and development is necessary.

## Special Components

### String
Because the focus of the experiment was on the properties of string, the team tested several types. The team chose four strings varying in non-biodegradable material, structure, and diameter. For polymer-based materials: a polypropylene, twine string with a diameter of 0.0500 inches and a nylon, monofilament string with a diameter of 0.0220 inches were tested (See Figure 8). For metal alloy material: a 304-type stainless steel wire with a diameter of 0.0200 inches and a 304-type stainless steel cable with a diameter of 0.0625 inches were tested (See Figure 9). The stainless steel cable was lubricated upon purchase with an oily substance that was not water soluble.

|Foam|Results|
|---|---|
|Teal Foam|Using the 3.750 inch basin, the foam was cut into 0.7500-inch square cross sections, duct-taped two pieces together at the top, and had tape in middle of basin. Two foam strings were wrapped around (2 strings on each side), water was convex in the dispenser and water flowed over side and on top of sponge. The foam strings worked slightly better when they were pre-wet, but still, a large amount of water was flowing on the outside.|
|Blue Foam|Using the 1.500 inch basin, the foam was cut into 0.2500-inch square cross sections, and were let hang loosely down. Four foam strings were on each side, with strings touching. There was no water tension in basin, and water was concave; water ran down and saturated all the foam strings. There was no need to pre-wet, as most of the water was running through the foam and not on the sides. The team was able to see that the water was flowing through the center of the foam as well as running down the outside. The foam strings were tested at several different speeds, and exhibited the same results at each speed.|
|White Foam|Using the 3.750 inch basin, the foam was cut into 0.7500-inch square cross sections, taped at top and had two strands on each side similar to the set-up for the teal strings. The water droplets were absorbed to foam strings: water was concave in the dispenser, and water flowed on outside and down in all of the strings. There was no need to pre-wet, but it was difficult to tell if water was only flowing down the outside of the strands or if it was also flowing through the center. Strands were very heavy after testing, which indicated that a lot of water had been absorbed in the center of the strand.|
|Grey Foam|Using the 3.750 inch basin, the initial tests (without modifying the foam) did not work, as water was not absorbed by foam and did not like flowing down the strands. The cords were then cut in half (inside of strand seemed more absorbent), and were wrapped around, tried with both flat side (inside) and rounded side towards the dispenser. Water formed droplets on material, but did not absorb much. Pre-wetting did not help, and water flowed over edge of dispenser and not onto the gray sponge.|
