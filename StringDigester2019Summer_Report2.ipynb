        "The String Digester Summer 2019 subteam continued research on designing a new trickling filter to eliminate problems associated with conventional designs. Experiments this summer focused on designing a water distribution system that does not encourage preferential flow, and creating a matrix of strings using \"loopy yarn\" as the filter media. An ideal string digester would distribute water uniformly onto a large number of densely packed strings from a spray. Initial testing demonstrated that a \"good\" spray can be achieved with flow rates on the order of 10 Î¼L/s, which is the amount needed to ensure proper cleaning by a biofilm. Initial testing found the string density resulting in the least preferential flow to be 30 strings/cm, although more trials are needed to confirm this result. Further experimentation is also needed to improve the spray pattern geometry, and to determine if the \"loopy yarn\" is suitable for biofilm growth. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater. "

        "\n",
        "The String Digester sub-team was created in response to the need for additional wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. A trickling filter is a secondary wastewater treatment system that removes organic matter from the wastewater through biological means, and is crucial for the removal of harmful pathogens. The goal of the String Digester subteam is to design a new trickling filter using strings as media that addresses the expensive and inefficient nature of conventional designs. Current trickling filters utilize a large mechanical distributor arm to spray water onto filter media, which requires periodic maintenance, can clog easily, and distributes water unevenly. Other inefficiencies in trickling filter operation are caused by preferential flow in the filter media itself. \n",
        "\n",
        "[//]: <> (The last sentence on preferential flow feels out of place. I suggest eliminating the mention of preferential flow here and just state that the uneven distribution causes inefficiency since you are talking about it next paragraph anyways)\n",
        "\n",
        "When designing a new trickling filter, a priority for the subteam was following the AguaClara philosophy: plants should be designed for low cost, high performance, and accessibility. Eliminating the need for large moving parts such as the distributor arm, would reduce the energy requirements and therefore the cost of a trickling filters. Additionally, decreasing preferential flow in the filter media would improve performance, making trickling filters more competitive with other secondary treatment methods such as aeration tanks. Finally, avoiding the use of small holes susceptible to clogging was an important consideration in the trickling filter design. \n",
        "\n",
        "Strings were chosen as a filter media for several reasons. Their high surface area to volume ratio means that a large amount of water can be treated in a small space. [Research](###String-Reaeration) also shows that strings have the ability to reaerate quickly so that energy-consuming fans are not needed to reintroduce oxygen to the system. Additionally, the subteam believed that the linear geometry of a string could minimize preferential flow. \n",
        "\n",
        "The main challenge faced by the subteam was finding a way to distribute a small amount of water evenly onto a large number of strings. The subteam proposed two distribution designs. The first involved impinging a stream of water onto a deflector plate to create a spray, which would be aimed at a row of densely packed strings. The second design consisted of a basin covered with holes on the bottom which guide water onto strings hanging from them. This design involves small holes, and will therefore only be feasible to implement if a simple method for cleaning them or preventing clogging is developed. For this reason, the subteam focused on the  first design which is described in more detail as follows:\n",

        "\n",
        "A peristltic pump is used to pump water through a flow accumulator and into a water column which serves as a holding container (See **Figure 1: Right**). A small orifice on the bottom of the water column releases a stream of water which is aligned directly above a deflector plate. The water impinges the deflector plate creating a spray that is aimed at a target area. This target area consists of a row of strings packed so closely together that they form a solid wall, as demonstrated in **Figure 2**.  These strings are wrapped through a 'loom' of smaller rods, forming a string matrix (**Figure 1: Left**). The water sprayed onto the target area hypothetically divides itself evenly between strings and travels through the string matrix. Organic matter is removed from the water by biofilms grown on the strings. Upon reaching the bottom of the string matrix, the water falls off into a collecting basin. **Figure 1** demonstrates this setup, however, more details will be provided in the [Methods](#Methods) section\n",

        "[//]: <> (Write literature review in past tense unless it's a fact or a theory, for example, someone stated not states)\n",
        "The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and preferential flow occurs. To clarify, preferential flow occurs when water repeatedly follows a specific pathway through the filter media opposed to others.Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused, and this is space ineffeicient. Spuhler recommended using specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation and allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018)](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215).\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to non-homogenous distribution of wastewater throughout the filter, there is significant documentation of other problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. Ali and co-authors stated that one major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not addressed, the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims to avoid the problem altogether by using a media that will not clog, however it is still an important factor to consider in the design, because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system has the potential to clog with biofilm growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ali also stated that the aforementioned sloughing and clogging is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Hydraulic loading rate is the amount of flow arriving at the treatment plant and entering the treatment process at any given time. Uneven HLR is caused by clogging of the distribution arm and an uneven distribution of influent. Therefore, proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of influent distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors consist of moving parts that require more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. \n",
        "\n",
        "The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system as seen below (**Figure 3**), utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the trickling filter medium and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a string media. However, Sperling and colleagues showed that both the fixed and rotating distribution systems have an inconsistent hydraulic load of the influent [(Sperling 2007)](https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402123.pdf). Therefore, the distribution system is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.\n",

        "Although there are multiple problems with trickling filters, one main advantage of trickling filters is that they have a relatively low residence time. This is a consideration which the team should plan to maintain in future designs. Hinton and Stensel measured residence time per unit length of between 30 and 40 sec/m with dye tests. Their predicted residence times, calculated from laminar flow theory, were closer to about 15 sec/m. The authors attributed this discrepancy to \"dye sorption and desorption by the biofilm.\" In either case, the residence time for a 5 meter deep trickling filter would be well under 5 minutes [(Hinton and Stensel 1991)](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135491901179/1-s2.0-0043135491901179-main.pdf?_tid=e8d2db22-8e0f-4d3c-a421-352ef74e6f5e&acdnat=1540500088_4808114af12660c061fbd139ac0fbd33). This short treatment time makes trickling filters an appealing wastewater treatment option if problems such as uneven HLR and clogging can be minimized.\n",

        "## Water Distribution\n",
        "Uniform water distribution is essential for many applications such as irrigation and water treatment. One common method for distributing water over a relatively large area is using a spray. There are several different methods for creating a spray, two being the Fixed Spray Plate Sprinklers (FSPS) and Rotating Spray Plate Sprinklers (RSPS). A comparative study conducted by [Faci et al. (2001)](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9437%282001%29127%3A4%28224%29) found that both methods resulted in a highly uniform distribution, with RSPS slightly more uniform than FSPS (94.6% versus 93.7%). While the study also focused on the effect of wind and overlapping sprinkler arrays, the methods and materials of the sprinklers are more applicable to this report.\n",
        "\n",
        "The FSPS design involves a water jet impinging on a fixed deflector plate, which then sprays water radially outward in the horizontal plane. The RSPS differs in that the deflector plate rotates when hit with the water jet. The nozzle diameters used in the study for both the FSPS and the RSPS were 3.8, 6.7, and 7.9mm. The deflector plate is what creates the spray pattern, and different deflectors can result in sprays at different angles. For the FSPS, the deflector had 33 grooves which resulted in flow being divided into 33 streams for the 3.8mm nozzle. One note from the study was that as the number of grooves in the deflector plate is increased, the drop size (for a set pressure and nozzle diameter) decreases [(Kincaid et al. 1996)](https://elibrary.asabe.org/azdez.asp?JID=3&AID=27568&CID=t1996&v=39&i=3&T=1&refer=7&access=&dabs=Y).\n",
        "\n",
        "For each of the sprinkler types, the distribution pattern was observed in varying wind conditions (low wind and medium wind) and with the sprinkler at different heights (1m and 2.5m) above the ground. Figure 2 shows that the RSPS results in a distribution with the highest density at the center (directly under the sprinkler) with the water density decreasing gradually as the radius from the center increases. However the FSPS results in a maximum density in a circular crown several meters from the center where the sprinkler is located. This difference in precipitation patterns is caused by the variation in the size of droplets from an RSPS (which can travel a wide range of distances depending on droplet diameter) compared with the relatively uniform droplet size from an FSPS.\n",

As the sprinkler height from the ground increases, the total wetted area increases as drops emitted in the horizontal direction are able to travel a longer distance. However, drops traveling further have a tendency to drift or evaporate causing less uniformity in the sprinkler distribution, especially at higher wind speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "While sprinklers create a uniform spray pattern that can be manipulated by varying parameters such as droplet size, nozzle diameter, and sprinkler height, sprinklers also require small orifices and large water velocities which may not be feasible with wastewater and potential clogging from biofilm growth. However the methods used to spray water outward in the radial direction could be useful when designing a system to spray water in a specific pattern, such as a straight line, and the methods used to split a water stream into several smaller jets may be applicable to future string digester designs.\n",

[Python code](##Python-Code) was written to perform such calculations. Additionally this relation can be used to calculate the total flow rate needed to serve a particular population, given that each person needs about [300 strings](###Number-of-Strings-Needed-to-Support-a-Small-Population) and there is a maximum flow rate of 10ðL/s per string.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Biofilm Growth\n",
        "A component of the string digester that is crucial to its success is the growth of biofilms on the strings. \"A biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells that is irreversibly associated (not removed by gentle rinsing) with a surface and enclosed in a matrix of primarily polysaccharide material.\" [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) Biofilm attachment is a complex process regulated by diverse characteristics of the growth medium, substratum, and cell surface. Biofilm on trickling filters is composed of a variety of organisms and are typically enclosed in a polysaccharide. The biofilm matrix may also contain mineral crystals, corrosion particles, and clay or silt particles. In conclusion, biofilms in wastewater systems are often highly complex [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)\n",
        "\n",
        "Some testing has been done of the growth of biofilm in different surfaces. One study compared growth on glossy electro-polished, bright annealed stainless steel to matte stainless steel and to PVC. The paper notes that stainless steel is hydrophilic and PVC is hydrophobic. In the last 45 days of the 167 day experiment, the matte steel had about 1.44 times more microorganisms than the electro-polished steel, and there was no significant difference between the PVC and polished steel. In discussion of why this occurs, Pedersen cites two reasons: \"detachment due to shear forces from the flow will be reduced on the rougher surface since cells can be shielded from the bulk flow and more substratum surface area may be available for the biofilm\" [(Pedersen 1990).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)\n",

        "\n",
        "## String reaeration\n",
        "For strings to be a viable filter media in a string digester, the wastewater being treated must be exposed to a sufficient amount of oxygen. This is because biofilms consume oxygen in the process of breaking down organic material. Whether reaeration occurs as water flows slowly down a string is an important question Krasnoff and Lee answered in their report [Potential Aeration of Water Trickling Down a String](https://github.com/monroews/CEE3530/blob/master/Projects/2019/1Project.pdf). The experiments performed in this investigation into the aeration of water as it flows down a string included testing two different types of string - a flat string and a loopy yarn. By observing dissolved oxygen (DO) levels for varying amounts of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from $Na_{2}SO_{3}$, it was concluded that aeration can occur when water trickles down both the flat string and the loopy yarn. \n",
        "\n",
        "A second set of trials where the COD level was kept constant at 200 mg/L tested the aeration potential at three different flow rates. As expected the slowest flow rate resulted in the highest levels of DO since the water had the most time for aeration to occur on the string. In each case, the loopy yarn had higher levels of DO and it was shown that the loopy yarn still allowed for significant aeration at high flow rates whie the flat string did not (reaeration of the loopy yarn occurred for flow rates ranging from 1.75 to 17.2 Î¼L/s). This means the loopy yarn is a more promising string digester filter media because a higher flow rate will increase the efficiency of the reactor without sacrificing the treatment. The higher rate of aeration in the yarn is attributed to it being hydrophilic and having \"loops\" that allow water drops to briefly collect. Because of this decreased flow rate and ability to reaerate, the loopy yarn was chosen over other materials tested by previous subteams (See [Previous Work](#Previous-work) for more details on these materials) to be used in Summer 2019 experiments. \n",
        "\n",
        "The results from these experiments showed that strings have the ability to reaerate naturally as water flows down them without needing an external source of air movement, such as with a fan. The type of string, the flow rate, and the level of COD are other variables that were proven to impact the degree of aeration and further tests with these parameters in mind would potentially lead to an ideal material and flowrate to consider for a working wastewater treatment plant. While the loopy yarn is promising in lab conditions, the biodegradability of acrylic yarn is something to consider. Under the conditions of a string digester, each strand of filter media will need to withstand a near constant flow of wastewater as well as host a biofilm for proper treatment. Further research into the effects of biofilm growth on several materials with the same \"loopy\" properties as the yarn will be needed. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Number of Strings Needed to Support a Small Population\n",
        "\n",
        "The [2010 World Water Day Fact Sheet](https://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/water_quality_facts_and_stats3.pdf) reported an annual wastewater production of 1500 km^3 in 2003. For a  6.4 billion population in 2003, this translates to a waste water production rate of 7.50 mL/s per person. A more recent [source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283744445_Global_Wastewater_and_Sludge_Production_Treatment_and_Use) from 2015 reported a municpal wastewater production of 330 km^3. With a world population of 7.2 billion at in 2015, this corresponds to a wastewater production rate of 1.4 mL/s per person. \n",
        "\n",
        "To investigate the feasibility of using strings as a filter media, the subteam calculated the number of strings needed to support the population of a small town of 10,000 people. Professor Weber-Shirk estimated that the average human creates wastewater at a rate of 3 mL/s, or 3000 microliters/second. The research in the above paragraph supports this estimate, as the calculated values are on the same order of magnitude. If the flowrate down each string is 10 microliters per second, each person would need 300 strings to keep up with their own wastewater production. Therefore a population of 10,000 people would need a trickling filter composed of 3 million strings.\n",

The same deflector plate was used for all experiments to follow unless noted otherwise. The strength of the faucet was adjusted until a wide, flat, and even spray was formed. The strength of the faucet was decreased gradually until the water spray could no longer be defined as 'good'. At this point, the deflector plate was removed and the flow rate of the sink was measured by timing how long it took to fill up a 3 liter container.

However, in the new design the spray is aimed at a larger area where the strings create a flat surface.\n",

        "An alternative water distribution system was designed and tested. It consisted of a small open-faced basin (**Figure 10**) with thirteen holes drilled into the bottom of it spaced out according to **Figure 11**.  A piece of loopy yarn was threaded through each hole and was secured by tying a knot on the top end. The knot was large enough to prevent the string from slipping back down the hole. A small hex nut was tied to the bottom of each string to act as a weight. The basin was mounted and tied to a support rod about 1 foot in the air. Thirteen cuvettes were numbered and glued to a thin plastic sheet according to **Figure 12**, and they were placed under the basin.  Each weighted string was placed into the closest cuvette. This was done to hold the strings in place,  but also as a means of comparing the amount of water that flowed down each string. The entire apparatus is shown in **Figure 13**. More details on the fabrication of the apparatus can be found in the [Manual](#Manual) section.\n",

        "\n",
        "The materials that produced the flattest spray patterns with the most even droplets were thin sheets of plastic of a short width, and the semi-cylindrical PVC pipes. Thicker and wider PVC sheets did not produce a good spray pattern, because the spray was highly uneven and a large portion of water dribbled away in an unwanted direction. The PVC cylinders were preferred over the flat plastic sheet, because it only sprayed water in one direction, rather than two directions. Furthermore, the 1/4 plastic pipe behaved better than the 1/2 PVC pipe, because less water was deflected backwards and wasted. \n",
        "\n",
        "The 'sprinkler' design also showed potential as a deflector plate. The droplets formed by this geometry were very small and evenly spaced. However, the sprinkler plate filled with water and overflowed, wasting a lot of water. The main problem with this design was that it did not project water in a flat line. Rather, the water was spread over a large circular area, which would be difficult to capture on a solid line of string. It was noted that the bottom of the bottle was not entirely flat and there was a large lip between where the water struck and the edge of the plate. Changing these characteristics could potentially improve the spray pattern. \n",
        "\n",
        "One problem that occurred with all deflecting plates described so far was the wasting of water deflected in the opposite direction of the spray. It was found however, that if the jet spray was applied exactly tangent to the interior of the 1/4 PVC pipe, the backwards flow was eliminated such that almost all water went into the spray. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another problem was that the spray produced by the 1/4 pipe was too wide for testing the experimental apparatus at small scales. A potential solution to this problem was to block part of the spray with a piece of PVC pipe cut in half (forming a semi-cylinder) to divert water away from the strings. However, this method changed the spray pattern by causing the spray to become narrower farther away from the deflector plate. \n",
        "\n",
        "Using a spoon as a deflector plate was much more successful at limiting the width of the spray. When tested, the widest spray achieved matched the width of the spoon, without a significant change in the desired spray pattern. \n",
        "This was especially useful for the  experiments with the string matrix, because the width of the \"wall of strings\" could easily be adjusted to match the width of the spoon or vice versa. Additionally, the handle of the spoon made it easier to direct water tangentially to the surface of the plate and further minimized the amount of water dripping off the back and sides of the deflector. Additional tests with a similarly modified ladle showed that while a wider \"spoon area\" could produce a wider spray, a much higher flow rate was needed to achieve this width. This flow rate would be too high for the small number of strings currently needed for testing. \n",

The minimum height leading to a 10 mL/s flow rate according to Person 1 and Person 2 was chosen due to energy constraints (i.e. choosing a higher distance would only require more energy to execute with little gain in spray quality).\n",

        "\n",
        "Several observations were made while building the initial string matrix that led to improvements in the design.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, the strings on the main rod overlapped significantly. A total of 85 strings fit in a distance of 2 cm. That is a string density of 42.5 strings per cm instead of the expected 19 strings per cm. This raises the question of whether overlapping strings prevent the water from being distributed uniformly. The overlapping strings may have been caused by the fact that the apparatus was originally designed for 10 rods rather than 16 rods, and the extra  strings may have forced them to overlap with each other. Later tests with the modified apparatus only used a portion of the rods to keep the strings from overlapping.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fewer rods were also used because in the original design, the rightmost string was loose in every layer of the matrix since the applied tension did not act towards the beaded rods. By wrapping fewer strings, only 9 rows instead of 17, there were no loose strings on the end and the process of wrapping and unwrapping to see the results of each experiment went much faster - which allowed time for more experiments to be run.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, the wrapping of strings in the initial design, steps 4-6 of **Figure 9**, required dexterity. With the addition of a third rod (labeled 2 in **Figure 5**) and by moving the rod each string is wrapped around (labeled 3 in **Figure 5**) to a higher location, the wrapping process went faster and the target location for the water was a more uniform wall of strings without the peaks and troughs that were present in the original design.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the water was dripped on the main rod in the initial setup for several minutes, the strings were felt by hand to get a preliminary idea of whether the strings were being evenly wet. The strings on the right of the apparatus were wet, while the strings on the left side were almost completely dry. These results indicate that preferential flow was occurring in some capacity. The wrapping pattern caused the strings to rest at different heights close to the main rod. **Figure 21** shows a side view of the strings where they converged at the main rod. There were distinct peaks and troughs in the 'wall of strings': the peaks corresponded to the left half of the string matrix, and the troughs corresponded to the right half of the matrix; the team suspected that the different angles of the strings leaving the main rod accounted for the preferential flow that was occurring.\n",

Ideas included using the strings like floss to periodically scrub the sides of the holes. Considering the simplicity of the basin with holes design, it may be reconsidered in the future. Other challenges include identifying the correct hole size and water height to get the desired flow rate, and finding a more efficient method of threading the strings through the holes. \n",

        "# Conclusions\n",
        "This semester the team focused on determining variables and methods for producing a spray that would get the water onto the strings. Many tests performed in the lab sink resulted in a better understanding of how sprays are formed, how they disperse, and what conditions (water height, deflector geometry, distance between water column and deflector) were optimal for creating a spray that could wet a line of strings. For the converging strings design the team concluded that a water height of between 10 and 20 cm, a modified spoon as a deflector plate, and a large distance (around 30 cm) between the water column and the deflector plate were optimal. \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the spray experiments, the team assembled a preliminary model for the string matrix where water would be sprayed on the strings. Taking a different direction than previous semester, the team stuck with loopy yarn as a filter media after students in CEE 4530 saw success with the yarn in terms of water aeration and volume flowing down each strand. The results from the string angle and converging string experiments were useful in constructing the model. \n",
        "\n",
        "The subteam began an experiment to determine the maximum density of strings on the main rod that simultaneously minimizes preferential flow. The best density found so far was 30 strings/cm, however many more trials must be conducted to increase confidence in these results, and densities higher than 30 strings/cm should be tested. \n",
        "\n",
        "Creating a rapid but efficient string digester would be impactful for the future of AguaClara's involvement in wastewater treatment. String digesters have the potential to greatly decrease the wastewater processing time and also decrease the organic solutes in the effluent. By maximizing potential surface area for the microbes to grow on using strings and sponges, thereby allowing for more microbial digestion of the water, some traditional trickling filter problems would be solved or minimized. Effluent from the UASB will require further treatment and the team believes that a string digester could provide the necessary treatment with minimal energy requirements.\n",

        "# Future Work\n",
        "\n",
        "The next step for the subteam should be to finish conducting experiments on preferential flow in the string matrix. Specifically, more trials should be conducted for the 'String Density vs. Water Distribution' experiment. Another test recommended to the subteam by Professor Weber-Shirk was applying a highly concentrated drop of red dye into the water column as it sprays clear water onto the string matrix. This would allow the subteam to observe the pathway that the water travels at a given instant in time. Another consideration for the future is to quantify the flow of water down individual strings to determine the extent of preferential flow, and to determine if the actual flow rate is similar to the desired 10 ðL/s per string. One way to quantify this flow would be to measure the distance that red dye travels down a string while applying clean water to the target area of the string matrix. \n",
        "\n",
        "Future work also includes determining the minimum spacing between strings so that water droplets do not flow between strings but the string matrix is as dense as possible. Testing this spacing could involve recreating the current model with smaller beads and rods spaced more tightly. \n",
        "\n",
        "Once a lab model is successful in terms of water dispensing and flow down strings, future teams will also need to perform experiments with biofilms on the loopy yarn or other potential filter media to treat wastewater. Experiments with synthetic wastewater could be conducted in the lab until the team has constructed an apparatus to test at the Ithaca wastewater plant and finally implement in an AguaClara wastewater treatment plant.
