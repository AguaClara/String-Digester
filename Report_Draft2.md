## Abstract

The string digester teamâ€™s objective for this semester is to continue research on designing a new wastewater treatment system to eliminate problems associated with current trickling filters. To improve consistency in wastewater treatment, experiments will be conducted using strings to optimize surface area. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater. Initial tests involving different string materials, biofilm growth, and string spacing will help define design parameters for the construction of a functioning string digester.

## Introduction
The String Digester sub-team originated due to the remaining need for continued wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. Looking to enhance industrial-scale trickling filters, work from the previous semester identified an issue with the process: a large amount of unused space is present in almost all treatment units due to preferential flow of wastewater. The primary objective of this sub-team is to continue to discover, construct, and tweak methods that can maximize the efficiency of trickling filter wastewater treatment. At conclusion of strings was viable option for filter media, this research of this semester will focus on augmenting the amount of used volume within the trickling filter by examining different materials of strings as well as the placement of this form of media on a filter. With this work, the team will work towards assessing the feasibility of the implementation of a modified trickling filter unit in future AguaClara treatment plants.

Research dealing with trickling filter wastewater treatment was ubiquitous in the 1970's and 1980's, however the method of treatment faced a lack of research in the following decades. Research on wastewater treatment shift more towards processes that were more active and higher in energy consumption. A notable feature of the trickling filter wastewater treatment is the low-energy requirements to run the reactor. This feature of this type of treatment is the driving force in the investigation of trickling filter research for AguaClara. This method of treatment has the potential to align with the mission of achieving hydraulically-driven systems which will be much more feasible in areas of the world in which capital expenditure is a major barrier for employing this technology.

With this, the team believes that there can be a large amount of progress that can be made by testing different materials for the new media, strings and constructing different designs for the placement of the strings. Research in these two areas can contribute towards designing a industrial-scale trickling filter system that is not only financially sustainable enough to be run in the low-resource country of Honduras, but is most efficient in use of treating wastewater. The String Digester sub-team strives to make significant technological improvements on industry-standard applications for the system.

## Previous work
###Spring 2018
Last semester, the Trickling Filter team spent a substantial amount of time doing research and gathering information on the operational difficulties, the kinetics, and typical design parameters of trickling filters. The team aimed to address many of the issues plant operators encounter with trickling filters, like clogging and ponding, lack of moisture in parts of the filter, and generally inefficiency of the filter. The two main areas for improvement the team identified were the filter media itself and the distribution system.

The team fabricated a bench top model for flow mapping and conducted several rounds of tests to determine the distribution of flow in trickling filters with small rock and marble media. From these experiments, the team noticed that there were significant portions of the media that never got wet and thus concluded that a substantial volume of the trickling filter was unused due to preferential flow and therefore there is wasted space. From these tests the team also showed that a uniform packing material is superior to a random material. In an effort to both maximize the surface area to volume ratio and to minimize the footprint of the system by not wasting space, the team shifted focus towards strings as a possible filter media. This concept led the team to start with very preliminary testing of a system that was essentially an overflowing basin with strings submerged at the top, inside the basin, and draped over the sides to guide water down to a collection bucket below. In these initial tests, the team members observed that the water overflowing does in fact follow the along strings when it overflows. From these observations, the String Digester team will now begin more rigorous testing on the concept and investigate whether using strings in a wastewater treatment system is truly viable.


## Literature Review
The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and thus preferential flow occurs. Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused. This leads to a less efficient treatment of organic matter than if all of the space in the filter were utilized. One suggestion from the author is specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation & allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018).](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215)

There is significant documentation of problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. One major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not address the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims avoid the problem altogether by using strings and not having a media that can clog up. It is still an important factor to consider in the design because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system will likely clog up with biofilm growth.

Ali et al. states that the most common problem in trickling filters is uncontrolled sloughing, which is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates. This can be particularly problematic after storm events when flooding results in very high hydraulic loading. It can also be caused by clogging of the distribution arm and uneven distribution of the influent [(Ali et al. 2017).](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf) There is potential for the development of a much-improved distribution system that could help to alleviate this problem.


Proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors require moving parts that require can more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. Additionally, this system will not serve the string-focused design.

The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system, utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the medium and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a string media.  

Unfortunately, these systems are also prone to clogging or blockage issues and similarly challenged by inconsistency of hydraulic load on the surface of the trickling filter. This is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.

#Remove
There can be issues with variations in temperature: biofilm thickness changes seasonally and can be low quality and uneven in cold temperatures. In freezing weather, formation of ice can cause clogging and structural damage to the trickling media. These are generally not major concerns for plants in equatorial regions, and so while important to note, will not be a focus for the team at this point.

[EM: Try focusing on articles/papers that identify issues with trickling filters that can be solved with the use of a string digester.]

In terms of odor as an indication of anaerobic conditions, the team will incorporate the need for airflow into their brainstorming of a novel geometry. Current trickling filters have inner rocks that are anoxic and anaerobic as airflow is not able to get to them. The spacing between each string should prevent any unwanted cohesive interactions between water particles to allow for sufficient biofilm aeration per string. This space between the strings will allow air to openly flow through the system.

[EM: Avoid using symbols ("and" instead of "&"). This does not belong in the literature review section; goals are more suited for the introduction.]


The team hopes to use strings as a solution to this problem. A trickling filter that is composed completely out of horizontal strings will allow for the same amount of flow on each string. In this way, all parts & materials of the trickling filter will be utilized.


## Methods
Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Initial Experiment
#### Experimental Apparatus
A scale was secured approximately 2 meters above a lab bench. The twine was attached to the bottom of the scale and allowed to hang down freely. See below for further information on the twine.

####Strings
For the string aspect of the experimental apparatus for the initial experiment, four strings varying in non-biodegradable material, structure, and diameter were chosen. For polymer-based materials, a polypropylene, twine string with a diameter of 0.0500 inches and a nylon, monofilament string with a diameter of 0.0220 inches were used. For metal alloy materials, a 304-type stainless steel wire with a diameter of 0.0200 inches and a 304-type stainless steel cable with a diameter of 0.0625 inches were used. The stainless steel cable was lubricated upon purchase.

For the remainder of the report, the following strings will be referred to by the following: polypropylene twine will be referred to as "twine", the nylon monofilament string will be referred to as "nylon string", the stainless steel wire will be referred to as "wire", and the stainless steel cable will be referred to as "cable".

First, the scope of what material of string to utilize was immediately narrowed to non-biodegradable materials due to the notion that biodegradable strings would not be able to withstand the detriments from the wastewater over time. Metal alloys and polymer-based materials were the most accessible materials to obtain, so it was decided to obtain equal amount of strings in each. Next, the structure and diameter of the strings was differentiated in each material group due to the notion that surface texture and/or diameter of the strings could have a strong effect on water flow.

#### Procedure
In this experiment, the team was trying to quantify the amount of water contained on each string. A narrow tube was connected to a peristaltic pump and was pumped at a known rate. The end of the tube was directed onto the top of the string. Measurements of the weight of the string were to be taken prior and post adding water to quantify the volume on water in the sheath that was hypothesized to form on the strings.

#### Results and Analysis
The method of directing the water onto the twine did not work. Water spiraled off the string and was not able to trickle down it. Therefore, no weight measurements were taken after there was water on the string and other materials were not tested out with this method.

### Recreated Experiment
#### Experimental Apparatus

The experiment from last semester was recreated using the new material strings mentioned above. A basin was filled with water and attached at an elevated surface about 1.5 m off the lab bench. Strings were then wrapped tightly around the top of the basin and at a metal rode below the basin. The strings were set up so they were evenly spaced and perpendicular to the ground.

####Strings
For the string aspect of the experimental apparatus for the recreated experiments, all four strings were re-utilized from the initial experiment. Reference to the "String" subsection of the Initial Experiment for more information on the strings.

#### Procedure
Water is pumped into the top of the dispenser at a known rate. The strings are wrapped around the dispenser and around a bottom pole in one long strand and pulled taught. The dispenser is filled to the top with water. As the water level overflows the dispenser basin, the water must find a path down. All four of the aforementioned materials were tested in this fashion with varying pumping rates.

#### Results and Analysis

The water did not like any of the materials. It avoided the strings mostly and flowed over the side of the dispenser at the top. In addition, the water that did get onto the materials formed droplets. The water would also start off flowing down the strings and then spiral off. The cable was hard to experiment on as it didn't conform to the sharp edges of the basin and did not make good contact with the water.



### Modified Experiments
#### Experimental Apparatus
Using the experimental setup described in the recreated experiment above, the team modified this with two pieces of pipe cut into quarter circles and glued onto the sides of the basin so the basin had downward sloping sides. To ensure the basin was watertight, glue was applied to all the seams. To keep the strings vertical when wrapped around the setup, a flat rectangle of acrylic was taped to the bar at bottom of the setup. This modified experiment was conducted in order to observe whether a gradual slope would help the water flow down onto the strings rather then straight down off the sides of the basin. This experiment was conducted in a similar way that the recreated experiment (above) was conducted in. A pump was used to regulate the flow of water into the basin. The team experimented with different flow rates and observed how water flowed or did not flow down the various strings.

The same four strings (wire, cable, twine, and nylon string) were used in this experiment. Since the cable was lubricated, the team washed it with soap and water before testing in hopes that this would make it less hydrophobic. The twine was also untwisted and tested as a secondary modification to the experiment.

####Strings
For the string aspect of the experimental apparatus for the modified experiments, all four strings were re-utilized from the initial experiment. Reference to the "String" subsection of the Initial Experiment for more information on the strings.

#### Procedure
This experiment was run in the same way as the recreated experiment (above) was run.

#### Results and Analysis
Despite introducing a gradual slope for the water to flow down, the results of this experiment were similar to the results from the recreated experiment. The strings were still hydrophobic so the water avoided flowing down the strings even when on the curved plastic. If the water did flow along the string on the plastic, droplets began to fall off the strings once they left the plastic at the top. The water overflowing from the basin was irregular and often flowed over the curved plastic in paths between the strings.
