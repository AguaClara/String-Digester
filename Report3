## Abstract

The string digester team’s objective for this semester is to continue research on designing a new wastewater treatment system to eliminate problems associated with current trickling filters. To improve consistency in wastewater treatment, experiments will be conducted using strings to optimize surface area. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater. Initial tests involving different string materials, biofilm growth, and string spacing will help define design parameters for the construction of a functioning string digester.

## Introduction
The String Digester sub-team originated due to the remaining need for continued wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. Looking to enhance industrial-scale trickling filters, work from the previous semester identified an issue with the process: a large amount of unused space is present in almost all treatment units due to preferential flow of wastewater. The primary objective of this sub-team is to continue to discover, construct, and tweak methods that can maximize the efficiency of trickling filter wastewater treatment. The team believes that the trickling filter treatment system can significantly increase in efficacy by innovating the media aspect of the  wastewater treatment system. After conclusion of strings being a viable option for filter media, the research of this semester will focus on augmenting the amount of used volume within the trickling filter by examining different materials of strings as well as the placement of this form of media on a filter. With this work, the team will work towards assessing the feasibility of the implementation of a modified trickling filter unit in future AguaClara treatment plant while striving to make significant technological improvements on industry-standard applications for the system.

Research dealing with trickling filter wastewater treatment was ubiquitous in the 1970's and 1980's, however, research on this method of treatment significantly decreased in following decades. Research on wastewater treatment shifted more towards processes higher in energy consumption. That being said, a notable feature of the trickling filter wastewater treatment are the low-energy requirements to run the system. The beneficial feature is the driving force to the development of the String Digester sub-team for AguaClara. With modification, the trickling filter treatment system carries much potential to be implemented in areas of the world in which capital expenditure is a major barrier for employing this technology.

Last semester, the Trickling Filter team spent a substantial amount of time doing research and gathering information on the operational difficulties, the kinetics, and typical design parameters of trickling filters. The team aimed to address many of the issues plant operators encounter with trickling filters, like clogging and ponding, lack of moisture in parts of the filter, and generally inefficiency of the filter. The two main areas for improvement the team identified were the filter media itself and the distribution system.

The team fabricated a bench top model for flow mapping and conducted several rounds of tests to determine the distribution of flow in trickling filters with small rock and marble media. From these experiments, the team noticed that there were significant portions of the media that never got wet and thus concluded that a substantial volume of the trickling filter was unused due to preferential flow and therefore there is wasted space. From these tests the team also showed that a uniform packing material is superior to a random material. In an effort to both maximize the surface area to volume ratio and to minimize the footprint of the system by not wasting space, the team shifted focus towards strings as a possible filter media. This concept led the team to start with very preliminary testing of a system that was essentially an overflowing basin with strings submerged at the top, inside the basin, and draped over the sides to guide water down to a collection bucket below. In these initial tests, the team members observed that the water overflowing does in fact follow the along strings when it overflows. From these observations, the String Digester team will now begin more rigorous testing on the concept and investigate whether using strings in a wastewater treatment system is truly viable.

## Literature Review
### Trickling Filters
The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and thus preferential flow occurs. Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused. This leads to a less efficient treatment of organic matter than if all of the space in the filter were utilized. One suggestion from the author is specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation & allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018).](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215)

There is significant documentation of problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. One major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not address the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims avoid the problem altogether by using strings and not having a media that can clog up. It is still an important factor to consider in the design because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system will likely clog up with biofilm growth.

Ali et al. states that the most common problem in trickling filters is uncontrolled sloughing, which is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates. This can be particularly problematic after storm events when flooding results in very high hydraulic loading. It can also be caused by clogging of the distribution arm and uneven distribution of the influent [(Ali et al. 2017).](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf) There is potential for the development of a much-improved distribution system that could help to alleviate this problem.


Proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors require moving parts that require can more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. Additionally, this system will not serve the string-focused design.

The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system, utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the medium and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a string media.

Unfortunately, these systems are also prone to clogging or blockage issues and similarly challenged by inconsistency of hydraulic load on the surface of the trickling filter. This is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters. [(Sperling 2007).](https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402123.pdf)


Trickling filters have a relatively low residence time, which the team should plan to maintain in future designs. Hinton and Stensel measured residence time per unit length of between 30 and 40 sec/m with dye tests. Their predicted residence times, calculated from laminar flow theory, were closer to about 15 sec/m. The authors attributed this discretion to "dye sorption and desorption by the biofilm." In either case, the residence time for a 5 meter deep trickling filter would be well under 5 minutes. [(Hinton and Stensel 1991).](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135491901179/1-s2.0-0043135491901179-main.pdf?_tid=e8d2db22-8e0f-4d3c-a421-352ef74e6f5e&acdnat=1540500088_4808114af12660c061fbd139ac0fbd33)

### Biofilm
A component of the string digester that is crucial to its success is the biofilm. "A biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells that is irreversibly associated (not removed by gentle rinsing) with a surface and enclosed in a matrix of primarily polysaccharide material." [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) Biofilm attachment is a complex process regulated by diverse characteristics of the growth medium, substratum, and cell surface. Biofilm on trickling filters are composed of a variety of organisms and are typically enclosed in a polysaccharide. The biofilm matrix may also contain mineral crystals, corrosion particles, and clay or silt particles. Biofilms in wastewater systems are often highly complex [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)

Some testing has been done of the growth of biofilm in different surfaces. One study compared growth on glossy electro-polished, bright annealed stainless steel to matte stainless steel and to PVC. The paper notes that stainless steel is hydrophilic and PVC is hydrophobic. In the last 45 days of the 167 day experiment, the matte steel had about 1.44 times more microorganisms than the electro-polished steel, and there was no significant difference between the PVC and polished steel. In discussion of why this occurs, Pedersen cites two reasons: "detachment due to shear forces from the flow will be reduced on the rougher surface since cells can be shielded from the bulk flow and more substratum surface area may be available for the biofilm" [(Pedersen 1990).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)


## Methods

### Initial Experiment

#### Objective of Experiment
The objective of the initial experiment was to determine the amount of water that could be held on different types of string and potentially make connections between specific properties of the strings and how much water they held at one time.

#### Experimental Apparatus
A scale was secured approximately 2 meters above a lab bench. A single string was attached to the bottom of the scale and allowed to hang down freely.

[Can you provide the photo or the diagram of the initial apparatus?]

#### Strings
For the string aspect of the experimental apparatus for the initial experiment, four strings varying in non-biodegradable material, structure, and diameter were chosen. For polymer-based materials, a polypropylene, twine string with a diameter of 0.0500 inches and a nylon, monofilament string with a diameter of 0.0220 inches were used. For metal alloy materials, a 304-type stainless steel wire with a diameter of 0.0200 inches and a 304-type stainless steel cable with a diameter of 0.0625 inches were used. The stainless steel cable was lubricated upon purchase.

For the remainder of the report, the following strings will be referred to by the following: polypropylene twine will be referred to as "twine", the nylon monofilament string will be referred to as "nylon string", the stainless steel wire will be referred to as "wire", and the stainless steel cable will be referred to as "cable".

First, the scope of what material of string to utilize was immediately narrowed to non-biodegradable materials due to the notion that biodegradable strings would not be able to withstand the detriments from the wastewater over time. Metal alloys and polymer-based materials were the most accessible materials to obtain, so it was decided to obtain equal amount of strings in each. Next, the structure and diameter of the strings was differentiated in each material group due to the notion that surface texture and/or diameter of the strings could have a strong effect on water flow.

#### Procedure
In this experiment, the team was attempting to quantify the amount of water contained on each string. A narrow tube was connected to a peristaltic pump and was pumped at a known rate. The end of the tube was directed onto the top of the string, to promote water flow onto the hanging string. Measurements of the weight of the string were to be taken before and after adding water for a short, specified period of time to quantify the volume on water in the hypothetical sheath that was to form on the strings.

#### Results and Analysis
The method of directing the water onto the string did not work. Water spiraled off the string upon immediate contact and was not able to trickle down the hanging string. Therefore, no weight measurements were able taken after attempting to direct water on the string, as the sheath did not form. The other materials were not tested out with this method, as this experiment was scrapped after the first test using the twine.

### Recreated Experiment

#### Objective of Experiment

The objective of this experiment was to see if the water would run down the strings using the basin distributing system from Spring 2018.

#### Experimental Apparatus
The experiment from last semester was recreated using the strings as media, rather than the cotton yarn. A basin was filled with water and attached at an elevated surface about 1.5 meters above the lab bench. Strings were then wrapped tightly around the top of the basin and at a metal rod below the basin. The strings were set up so they were evenly spaced and perpendicular to the ground. The amount of a string wrapped on the apparatus as well as the different types of strings wrapped on the apparatus was up to the discretion of the sub-team.

#### Strings
For the string aspect of the experimental apparatus for the recreated experiments, all four strings were re-utilized from the initial experiment. Reference to the "String" subsection of the Initial Experiment for more information on the strings.

#### Procedure
 The desired strings were wrapped around the dispenser and around a bottom pole in one long strand (amount of strings is at discretion of sub-team) and pulled taught. The basin was filled with water using the peristaltic pump to induce overflow. As the water overflows the basin, the water will find a path down. All four of the aforementioned materials were tested in this fashion at varying pumping rates.

#### Results and Analysis

The water did not like any of the materials. It avoided the strings mostly and flowed over the side of the dispenser at the top. In addition, the water that did get onto the materials formed droplets. The water would also start off flowing down the strings and then spiral off. The cable was hard to experiment on as it didn't conform to the sharp edges of the basin and did not make good contact with the water.


### Modified Experiments

#### Objective of Experiment

The team objective on the next experiment was to see if the team could use a modified design of the system to "encourage" the water to attach to and better follow along the string.

#### Experimental Apparatus

Because the strings were hydrophobic, the team modified the experiment to give the water more time to flow onto the string. Using the experimental setup described in the recreated experiment (mentioned above), the team modified the basin by attaching two plastic arcs. This was done by slicing pieces of plastic pipe into quarters to create arcs and glueing the arcs onto the sides of the basin so that the basin had downward sloping sides. To ensure the basin was watertight, glue was applied to all the seams. To keep the strings vertical when wrapped around the setup, a flat rectangle of acrylic was taped to the bar at bottom of the setup. This modified experiment was conducted in order to observe whether a gradual slope would help the water flow down onto the strings rather then straight down off the sides of the basin. This experiment was conducted in a similar way that the recreated experiment (mentioned above) was conducted in. A pump was used to regulate the flow of water into the basin. The team experimented with different flow rates and observed how water flowed or did not flow down the various strings.

The same four strings (wire, cable, twine, and nylon string) were used in this experiment. Since the cable was lubricated, the team washed it with soap and water before testing in hopes that this would make it less hydrophobic. The twine was also untwisted and tested as a secondary modification to the experiment.

#### Strings
For the string aspect of the experimental apparatus for the modified experiments, all four strings were re-utilized from the initial experiment. Reference to the "String" subsection of the Initial Experiment for more information on the strings.

#### Procedure
This experiment was run in the same way as the recreated experiment (mentioned above) was run.

#### Results and Analysis
Despite introducing a gradual slope for the water to flow down, the results of this experiment were similar to the results from the recreated experiment. The strings were still hydrophobic so the water avoided flowing down the strings even when on the curved plastic. If the water did flow along the string on the plastic, droplets began to fall off the strings once they left the plastic at the top. The water overflowing from the basin was irregular and often flowed over the curved plastic in paths between the strings.


### New Materials Experiments

#### Objective of Experiment

The team objective on this set of experiments was to further experiment with metal-alloy based chains, and to determine if foams could be feasible as a string medium.

#### Experimental Apparatus

To get a broad sense of the feasibility of the new materials as string media, each string was put through three different tests that varied by physical features of the experimental apparatuses. The first test was using the experimental setup described in the recreated experiment. The second test was using the experimental setup described in the modified experiment with the winged basin (mentioned above). The third test was newly created, and involved using a basin that was half the size of the original basin used in the recreated experiment; in this case, the basin was 1.5 inches in length. This was done by fabricating a new basin based on the desired length. This three tests were conducted in order to observe water flow on the string media with and without physical manipulations. The tests were conducted in a similar way that the recreated and modified experiments (mentioned above) were conducted in. A pump was used to regulate the flow of water into the basin. The team experimented with different flow rates and observed how water flowed or did not flow down the various strings.

The same four strings (wire, cable, twine, and nylon string) were used in this experiment. Since the cable was lubricated, the team washed it with soap and water before testing in hopes that this would make it less hydrophobic. The twine was also untwisted and tested as a secondary modification to the experiment.

#### Strings
For the string aspect of the new materials experiments, eight new materials were purchased to use as the string media. For metal alloy-based materials, four stainless steel chains that varied in chain type were purchased. A  For metal alloy materials, a 304-type stainless steel wire with a diameter of 0.0200 inches and a 304-type stainless steel cable with a diameter of 0.0625 inches were used. The stainless steel cable was lubricated upon purchase.

For the remainder of the report, the following strings will be referred to by the following: polypropylene twine will be referred to as "twine", the nylon monofilament string will be referred to as "nylon string", the stainless steel wire will be referred to as "wire", and the stainless steel cable will be referred to as "cable".

First, the scope of what material of string to utilize was immediately narrowed to non-biodegradable materials due to the notion that biodegradable strings would not be able to withstand the detriments from the wastewater over time. Metal alloys and polymer-based materials were the most accessible materials to obtain, so it was decided to obtain equal amount of strings in each. Next, the structure and diameter of the strings was differentiated in each material group due to the notion that surface texture and/or diameter of the strings could have a strong effect on water flow.

#### Procedure
This experiment was run in the same way as the recreated experiment (mentioned above) was run.

#### Results and Analysis
Despite introducing a gradual slope for the water to flow down, the results of this experiment were similar to the results from the recreated experiment. The strings were still hydrophobic so the water avoided flowing down the strings even when on the curved plastic. If the water did flow along the string on the plastic, droplets began to fall off the strings once they left the plastic at the top. The water overflowing from the basin was irregular and often flowed over the curved plastic in paths between the strings.

[It's good that all the details of three experiments were provided. But you can rearrange them to delete the overlap and emphasis the contrast or the advantages of the updated experiment. Also, we expect to see more analysis¸of your result.]

## Conclusions
The team experienced difficulties  finding a material for the strings that is both non-biodegradable and will allow the wastewater to stay on the string as it falls over the side of the basin instead of coming off and just falling freely. Experimentation showed that the plastic polymer based string options will not work as a filter media unless somehow altered to make them hydrophilic. The stainless steel based strings show more potential but still seem to require some modifications to the design before they will work with any consistency. The results from experiments suggest that the team's current path may not lead to a successful design and the team should continue to think on how to address the issue of keeping the water on the string.

[Explain why that's important to AguaClara.]


## Future Work
In the next few weeks, the team will continue to investigate potential string material that will allow for proper treatment to occur. In terms of how exactly the team will do this, more thought and brainstorming is needed. One potential avenue would be to inoculate the string with biofilm before putting it in the system with the basin in the hopes that the presence of biofilm will make the surface of the string more hydrophilic and that water will not "fall off" the string. If research with the string method continues to not show any promising results, the team may move away from strings and using surface tension. A possible alternative method would be using steeply slanted, quite thin plates as the media surface. This would use gravity to keep the water on the surface instead of relying on surface tension and cohesion. The team still sees the potential for a trickling filter-influenced design for wastewater treatment in a future AguaClara plant, but the inclusion of strings as a media is not yet certain.
