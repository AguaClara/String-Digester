## Abstract
The objective of String Digester for the Spring 2019 semester was to continue research on revamping a wastewater treatment system to eliminate problems associated with current trickling filters. To improve consistency in wastewater treatment, experiments were conducted using metallic and plastic chains to optimize surface area. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater. These tests involved testing different chain types and synthetic materials for their hydrophillic properties, fabricating and testing reactors for efficiency, and researching biofilm growth to help define design parameters for the construction of a functioning string digester.

## Introduction
The String Digester sub-team was created in response to the remaining need for secondary wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. A trickling filter is a secondary wastewater treatment system that removes organic matter from the wastewater through biological means, and is crucial for the removal of harmful pathogens. Looking to improve on the traditional industrial-scale trickling filter design, previous work identified an issue with the process: there is a substantial amount of unused space in the trickling treatment unit due to the uneven flow of wastewater across the system (preferential flow). The primary objective of this sub-team is to continue to develop a novel design for a highly efficient trickling filter with a minimized footprint in terms of space. Following the conclusion from Fall 2018, that metal chains would be a viable trickling media due to their retention of water, the team decided to focus this semester's research on trying to determine what material and type of chain would work best in terms of water retention and biofilm growth and from there, determining the best matrix for these chains to be in to maximize water retention on chain media. In addition, the team focused on two polymer strings: dacron and aramid as they are both more hydrophilic in structure and therefore the team hoped they would retain water better. With this work, the team will work towards assessing the feasibility of a modified trickling filter unit in future AguaClara treatment plants while striving to make significant technological improvements on industry-standard applications for the system.

Research dealing with trickling filter wastewater treatment was ubiquitous in the 1970's and 1980's, however, the research in this field has significantly declined in the following decades. Moreover, research involving string as a media in this method of treatment is almost nonexistent. Research on secondary wastewater treatment originally focused on performance of trickling filters, but now has shifted towards processes higher in energy consumption. The philosophy for AguaClara plants is to create a plant that is optimized for low cost and a high performance, and looking at the regions a future wastewater plant would serve, trickling filters are a promising technology due to their low-energy requirements. By researching methods to increase the efficiency in these plants, these treatment systems could have the potential to fit AguaClara's ideals. **[This sentence is unclear. Don't know what it is saying exactly.. Does it mean that AC does work in reducing unused space, making it ideal? -- Addressed TM (I meant to say that research in increasing efficiency will allow it to be implemented in AguaClara's target locations.)]**. Maintaining these ideals are and will be a priority in the team's work in designing the reactor. With modification, the trickling filter treatment system carries much potential to be implemented in areas of the world in which capital expenditure is a major barrier for employing traditional secondary wastewater treatment (aeration tanks).


## Literature Review
### Trickling Filters
The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and preferential flow occurs. Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused. This leads to a less efficient treatment of organic matter than if all of the space in the filter were utilized. In their paper, Spuhler recommends using specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation & allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018).](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215)

In addition to non-homogenous distribution of wastewater throughout the filter, there is significant documentation of other problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. Ali and co-authors state that one major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not addressed, the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims to avoid the problem altogether by using chains and having a media that will not clog up. It is still an important factor to consider in the design because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system will likely clog up with biofilm growth.

Ali also states that the aforementioned sloughing and clogging is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Hydraulic loading rate is the amount of flow arriving at the treatment plant and going entering the treatment process at any given time. Uneven HLR is caused by clogging of the distribution arm and an uneven distribution of influent. Therefore, proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of influent distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors consist of moving parts that require more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. Additionally, this system will not serve the chain-focused design.

The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system as seen below (**Figure 1.**), utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the trickling filter medium   **[medium up to this point has not been mentioned. Does this refer to growth medium or media? If possible keep consistent --Addressed ZS]** and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a chain media. However, Sperling and colleagues showed that both the fixed and rotating distribution systems have an inconsistent hydraulic load of the influent [(Sperling 2007)](https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402123.pdf). Therefore, the distribution system is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.

Although there are multiple problems with trickling filters, one main advantage of trickling filters is that they have a relatively low residence time. This is a consideration which the team should plan to maintain in future designs. Hinton and Stensel measured residence time per unit length of between 30 and 40 sec/m with dye tests. Their predicted residence times, calculated from laminar flow theory, were closer to about 15 sec/m. The authors attributed this discrepancy **[discretion may not be the right word here.. difference/discrepancy? --Addressed ZS]** to "dye sorption and desorption by the biofilm." In either case, the residence time for a 5 meter deep trickling filter would be well under 5 minutes [(Hinton and Stensel 1991)](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135491901179/1-s2.0-0043135491901179-main.pdf?_tid=e8d2db22-8e0f-4d3c-a421-352ef74e6f5e&acdnat=1540500088_4808114af12660c061fbd139ac0fbd33). This short treatment time makes trickling filters an appealing wastewater treatment option if problems such as uneven HLR and clogging can be minimized.

Low-rate filters are used when there is a lower BOD. These are typically 0.9 to 2.4 meters in height. Rock filters are usually not hydraulically limited and have a loading rate of 0.01 to 0.04 $\frac{L}{m^2*s}$. In comparison, plastic media is wet at a rate of 0.4 $\frac{L}{m^2*s}$ to prevent the media from drying out. See Table 1. for typical BOD removal rates for various trickling filters [(Wastewater... 2000)](https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/trickling_filt_nitrification.pdf).

In addition to rate of loading, the cost of building a trickling filter was also researched. It is summarized in the table below with O&M standing for operation and maintenance from [Wastewater... 2000](https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/trickling_filt_nitrification.pdf).

</center>

According to [Farmer 2013](https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/trickling_filt_nitrification.pdf), typical trickling filters are designed to remove CBOD (carbonaceous biological oxygen demand) and NOD (nitrogenous oxygen demand). He suggests a hydraulic wetting rate range for BOD removal systems between 30 to 40 $\frac{L}{min*m^2}$ and 30 to 80 $\frac{L}{min*m^2}$ for nitrification systems. Converted to the units from the EPA, these come out to 0.5 - 0.66 $\frac{L}{s*m^2}$ and 0.5 - 1.33 $\frac{L}{s*m^2}$. These ranges are similar to the wetting rates the EPA suggested for the plastic media.

### Biofilm
A component of the string digester that is crucial to its success is the growth of biofilm on the chains. "A biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells that is irreversibly associated (not removed by gentle rinsing) with a surface and enclosed in a matrix of primarily polysaccharide material." [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) Biofilm attachment is a complex process regulated by diverse characteristics of the growth medium, substratum, and cell surface. Biofilm on trickling filters is composed of a variety of organisms and are typically enclosed in a polysaccharide. The biofilm matrix may also contain mineral crystals, corrosion particles, and clay or silt particles. In conclusion, biofilms in wastewater systems are often highly complex [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) **[Last sentence is kind of just oddly placed. Maybe just start it off with "In conclusion," -- Addressed ZS]**

Some testing has been done of the growth of biofilm in different surfaces. One study compared growth on glossy electro-polished, bright annealed stainless steel to matte stainless steel and to PVC. The paper notes that stainless steel is hydrophilic and PVC is hydrophobic. In the last 45 days of the 167 day experiment, the matte steel had about 1.44 times more microorganisms than the electro-polished steel, and there was no significant difference between the PVC and polished steel. In discussion of why this occurs, Pedersen cites two reasons: "detachment due to shear forces from the flow will be reduced on the rougher surface since cells can be shielded from the bulk flow and more substratum surface area may be available for the biofilm" [(Pedersen 1990).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) [Translate pedersen!]


In another experiment, three different types of plastic often used in pipe production were investigated for biofilm formation. These materials were PVC, PEX, and HDPE. After two years of system operation, which included weekly pipeline flushing, biofilm analyses were taken. It was found that the PEX pipe had the highest number of bacteria growing (1.15*10<sup>3</sup> $\frac{CFU}{cm^2}$; CFU: colony-forming unit), HDPE pipes had two times less the amount of bacteria (451 $\frac{CFU}{cm^2}$), and PVC surfaces had a significantly lower bacteria count (193 $\frac{CFU}{cm^2}$). However, the number of microorganisms found in the pipes was not related to the number of mineral deposits found, as HDPE pipes had the thickest biofilms with bacteria attached to mineral deposits or immersed in exopolymers. Bacteria did not form large aggregates on PEX surfaces, and PVC biofilm was only made of single cells and did not have any mineral deposits. It was concluded that the ranking of susceptibility to biofilm growth and colonization was HDPE, PEX, and PVC respectively. [(A. Rożej et al., 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4282696/)


Studies have also been conducted about the bacteria that produce the biofilm on the stainless steel. Many of these studies involve curli-producing bacteria. Curli fibers "are the major proteinaceous component of a complex extracellular matrix produced by many Enterobacteriaceae" and "are involved in adhesion to surfaces, cell aggregation, and biofilm formation" [(Barnhart and Chapman).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2838481/) One such study focused on *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 bacteria with 6 individual strains, three of which produced curli and three which did not. The study found that the gene for curli production did not affect the attachment of the bacteria to the stainless steel, but it did affect the formation of biofilms. Only the curli producing strains were able to form biofilms [(Ryu et al. 2004).](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2004.01591.x) However, since *E. coli* are commonly found in wastewater, it is probable for biofilm to be able to grow on the stainless steel chains as long as some **[strains of E. coli --Addressed GS]** strains of E. Coli with the curli-producing gene is present in the wastewater and the flow rate is not too fast. So, assuming that the bacteria will most likely be present and once the biofilm is built up on each of the chains, the main issue then becomes preventing accumulated biofilm from falling off one chain and then, in a domino effect, dragging it off other chains as well.

## Previous Works
### Spring 2018
In Spring 2018, the Trickling Filter team spent a substantial amount of time doing research on the operational difficulties, the kinetics, and typical design parameters of trickling filters. The team aimed to address many of the issues plant operators encounter with trickling filters, like clogging and ponding, lack of moisture in parts of the filter, and general inefficiency of the filter. The two main areas for improvement the team identified were the filter media itself and the distribution system ([Spring 2018 Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/String-Digester/blob/master/Spring%20'18/TricklingFilter_Final_Report.md)).

The team fabricated a bench top model for flow mapping and conducted several rounds of tests to determine the distribution of flow in trickling filters with small rock and marble media. From these experiments, the team noticed that there were significant portions of the media that never got wet and thus concluded that a substantial volume of the trickling filter was unused due to preferential flow. From these tests the team also showed that a uniform packing material is superior to an irregularly shaped material. In an effort to both maximize the surface area to volume ratio and to minimize the footprint of the system by not wasting space, the team shifted focus towards strings as a possible filter media. This concept led the team to start with very preliminary testing of a system that was essentially an overflowing basin with strings submerged at the top, inside the basin, and draped over the sides to guide water down to a collection bucket below (See **Figure 2.**, the same experimental set-up used in Spring 2018). In these initial tests, the team members observed that the water did in fact follow the along strings when it overflowed. From these observations, the String Digester team began to design more rigorous tests on the concept and planned to investigate whether using strings in a wastewater treatment system is truly viable.

**Figure 2**. Experimental Set-up with water basin from [Fall 2018 Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/String-Digester/blob/master/Fall%20'18/Final_Report_stringdigester.md) Section 1.2.2 Figure 2.
</center>

### Fall 2018
In Fall 2018, the team continued experimentation with the overflowing basin from the previous semester. The string yarn was abandoned due to its degradability. Nylon, polypropylene, and a stainless steel wire and cable were first tested on the same set-up from Spring 2018 with the overflowing basin. The plastics were chosen for their non-biodegradability; however, the stainless steel wires may be susceptible to corrosion. All of the preceding materials did not perform well on the basin set-up as the water did not follow the strands due to their hydrophobicity.


Next, two foams and two stainless steel chains were tested on the same basin in addition to a winged basin set up. These materials were able to retain water as it trickled down. The blue foam worked exceptionally well as it absorbed water. The initial testing done on these materials suggests they could work in the proposed system and make the string digester technology possible. Further testing will be done on the chains as the foams are thought to easily clog; therefore, they are not confirmed to be a viable solution at this point. See [Fall 2018 Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/String-Digester/blob/master/Fall%20'18/Final_Report_stringdigester.md) for more information.

## Methods
### Single Chain Experiments
#### Objectives of Experiments
The objective of the initial experiment was to determine the peak amount of water that the chain could hold at a single point in time, the residence time for water on the chain at different flow rates, and the height needed for a 15 minute residence time at different flow rates. Dr. Weber-Shirk suggested the team aim for the water to have a 15 minute residence time on the string in order to give the bioflim sufficient time to digest the microbes in the water.

#### Experimental Apparatus
A scale was secured approximately one meter above a lab bench resting on supports at each corner so that the bottom of the scale was left accessible. A 3-foot single chain was attached to the hook on the bottom of the scale and was allowed to hang down freely (see **Figure 3** below). The hook on the scale measured the weight of the chain. Reference the [Single Chain Experiment Manual](#Single-Chain-Experiment) section for a detailed explanation of the set-up.

</center>

#### Procedure
Reference the [Single Chain Experiments Manual](#Single-Chain-Experiment) section for a detailed procedure. The scale was zeroed with the chain hanging on the scale so that the scale would only measure the weight of the water on the chain. Narrow tubing (ID: 16) was connected to a peristaltic pump and water was pumped at a known rate. The end of the tube was directed onto the top of the chain hanging from the scale, in an attempt to allow water to flow onto and down the hanging chain.

The idea was to get water flowing onto the chain and then, while continuously pumping water onto the chain, measure the weight of the water on the chain at a moment in time. Because the scale reading often fluctuated, a range of weights was recorded. The weight of the water (in grams) on the chain was recorded for several different flow rates of water. The first two flow rates used were 1.5 mL/s and 3 mL/s and then every multiple of 5 from 5-80 mL/s was used after the initial two.

From these measurements, the team was able to quantify how much water the chain could hold per unit length. After, the team calculated the residence time by dividing the volume of water on the chain by flow rate. From this information, the team calculated the height of the chain needed for a residence time of 15 minutes.

**[Starting in procedure you start using a residence time of 15 minutes but I don't think you have ever justified why you do. Could you do that?] --Addressed KL**

### Chain Matrix Experiment
#### Objective of Experiment
The objective of this chain matrix experiment was to identify and compare the water retention of multiple chains in the same basin of water.

#### Experimental Apparatus
Six evenly spaced holes were drilled into a basin. Six 3-foot chains were subsequently inserted into these holes and were left to hang freely from the other end (see **Figure 4**). The basin was placed on top of a rod that rested across from the four supports in the previous experiment (see **Figure 5.**) **[I believe you mean figure 6 here] --Addressed KL**. Reference the [Chain Matrix Experiment](#Chain-Matrix-Experiment) Manual section for detailed information on the Experimental Apparatus.

#### Procedure
The narrow tubing (ID: 16) was connected to a peristaltic pump and was directed into the basin. The peristaltic pump was used to control the amount of water that flowed into the basin. The amount of water flowing onto each chain was analyzed and compared for retention.

### Single Dacron String Experiment
#### Objectives of Experiment
The objectives of the single Dacron string experiment were to determine how uniformly water flowed down the string and the length of a string needed for the  water to have a 15-minute residence time on the string.

#### Experimental Apparatus
A 30-inch wetted Dacron string was hooked onto the bottom of a scale and allowed to hang freely from the scale. The scale, which measured the weight of the string, was placed on top of two support beams above the lab bench. Orange-yellow color-coded micro-tubing (ID: 0.05) connected to the peristaltic pump was draped over the support beam and taped onto a flat rod between the two beams so that the tubing was allowed to just barely touch the side of the top part of the string. Reference the [Single Dacron String Experiment Manual](#Single-Dacron-Experiment-Manual) for a detailed explanation of the set-up.

#### Procedure
Reference the [Single Dacron String Experiment Manual](#Single-Dacron-Experiment-Manual) for a detailed explanation of the procedure.The string was dipped in water prior to hanging on the scale in order to allow water to stay on the string more effectively. The scale was zeroed with the string hanging on the scale so that the scale would only measure the weight of the water flowing on the string. Water was pumped at a controlled flow rate through the tubing and onto the string. The idea was to allow the tubing to just barely touch the string so that it could release water directly onto the string without putting the string at an angle.

Once the scale began reading steady weights, a range of weights was recorded for an RPM(revolution/minute) starting at 77.8, then 70, followed by every 10 RPM after that (60, 50,...,10 RPM) and finally at 1.6 RPM(the smallest possible RPM), which correlated to flow rates starting at 0.0246 mL/s down to .0005 mL/s. Then, residence times on the string were calculated by dividing the total weight on the string by flow rate (in mL/s) for each RPM tested. Finally, the length of the string needed for the water to have a retention time of 15 minutes was calculated using the retention time per meter of string.

### Theoretical Efficency of String Digester
####Objective of Experiment
The goal of this portion was to determine theoretically if a string digester would be more cost and space efficient than current trickling filter technologies.
####Procedure
Results from the Single Dacron String experiment were used. The lowest flow rate was picked and strings were assumed to be either 0.5 cm or 0.2 cm apart in all directions. The total flow rate per m <sup>2</sup> and cost was calculated and compared to current trickling filter technologies.

###Capillary Action Testing
####Objective of Experiments
The goal of this experiment was to determine if capillary action is possible using the 0.3 mm Dacron string.
####Experimental Apparatus
Ten 80 inch Dacron strings were used and were double backed so that each strand was 40 inches. The strands were wrapped around a tube in the bottom of the basin and emerged in a water and dye solution. The strings were then draped over a pipe about 5 cm above the surface of the solution and left to hang down over the other side. See **Figure 10.** for the set-up.

####Procedure
The set-up described in the experimental apparatus was used. A basin was placed on a scale at the bottom of the strings. A timer was started when the dye solution was added into the input basin. Results were noted qualitatively and quantitatively. The migration of the dye was assed with time and weight was to be recorded at the 20 min, 1 hour, and 2 hours marks in the lower basin where water was expected to flow to.

### Grouped Strings Capillary Action Experiment
#### Objective of Experiment
The initial objective of this experiment was to determine whether grouping several Dacron strings would result in capillary action. From there, the objectives were to determine the amount (weight) of water transferred to the string through capillary action and the flow rate of the water on the string.

#### Experimental Apparatus
10 80-inch Dacron strings were used and were doubled backed so that there was a total of 20 40-inch strings. The strands were wrapped around a tube in the bottom of the basin. The strands were draped over the side of the basin and were allowed to hang freely in the air. The wrapped strands were then pushed together tightly so that they formed one "clump" of strings. Lastly, 3 roughly evenly spaced rubber bands were wrapped around the clump of strings in order to keep them all together in a uniform manner. Reference the [Grouped Strings Capillary Action Experiment Manual](#Group-Strings-Capillary-Action-Experiment-Manual) for a detailed explanation of the set-up.

#### Procedure
The set-up described in the experimental apparatus was used. A basin was placed on a scale at the bottom of the strings. A timer was started when water was poured into the input basin. First, qualitative results were noted. Then, weight measurements of the basin on the scale were taken at various times for 2 hours. From these measurements, the flow rates of the water on the strings at times throughout the 2 hours were calculated. Reference the [Grouped Strings Capillary Action Experiment Manual](#Group-Strings-Capillary-Action-Experiment-Manual) for a detailed explanation of the procedure.

### Single Aramid Rope Experiment
#### Objective of Experiment
The objective of the single Aramid rope experiment was to qualitatively examine how the water flowed down the rope and to determine whether it could be a potential material for a string digester.

#### Experimental Apparatus
The top of a 36 inch Aramid rope was tied to a Dacron string loop in order to hook it onto the bottom of a scale. The scale, which measured the weight of the rope, was placed on top of two support beams above the lab bench. Orange-yellow color-coded micro-tubing (ID: 0.05) connected to a peristaltic pump was draped over the support beam and taped onto a flat rod between the two beams so that the tubing was fixed just above the top of the rope. The idea was to allow the tubing to hang just above the rope so that it could release water directly on top of the rope.

#### Procedure
A basin was placed directly underneath the rope in order to catch the water leaving the rope. Because this experiment was mostly for qualitative purposes, quantitative data was not taken. Once water was released from the tubing and flowed on to the rope, observations on how uniformly and quickly the water flowed down the rope were recorded. Reference the [Single Aramid Rope Experiment Manual](#Single-Aramid-Rope-Experiment-Manual) for a detailed explanation of the procedure.


## Results and Analysis
### Single Chain Experiment
**[By simply measuring the mass and length of the chain at a controlled flow rate --Addressed GS]** By simply measuring the mass and length of the chain at a controlled flow rate, the **[the --Addressed GS]** single chain experiment yielded results of volume of water on the chain, residence time, and height needed for a 15 minute residence time. By dividing the mass on the chain by the density of water, which is 1 g/ml, the volume of water on the chain was obtained. When graphed against flow rate, this calculation yielded a curve best fit by a power series with an R<sup>2</sup> of .991. This is an appropriate result because power series are most often used for data that compares measurements that increase at a specific rate. The flow rate was increased in small increments and the volume of water on the chain would also increase at a specific rate until it reached a certain threshold, which can be seen towards the end of the line graph where the volume of water on the chain starts leveling out as expected.

</center>

Furthermore, residence time was calculated by dividing the volume of water on the chain (ml) by the flow rate (ml/min) and then converting to seconds. Understanding the residence time of water at different flow rates is important because the optimal residence time is 15 minutes. Again, since the flow rate is increasing in small increments a power series is used for the line of best fit, this time with an R<sup>2</sup> value of .996. Since the residence time drastically decreases as the flow rate increases, it is understood that an actual string digester system made with chains would have to run at low flow rates with really long chains. For example, if it were run at 1.5 ml/min at least a 13.716-meter chain would be needed for the optimal 15-minute residence time, which might be unattainable in some circumstances and the issue of clogging of pipes and tubes comes into play because the flow rate is so low. Thus, other materials may be worth looking into as possible strings in the system that will have better residence time.

</center>

Another result the experiment supplied was the height of the chain that would be needed for a 15 min residence time at each flow rate. The height needed was calculated by dividing 900 seconds (15 mins) by the residence time(s) by the length of the chain, in this case .9144 meters. Then as seen in **Figure 17.** another line with a power series best fit is yielded this time with a R<sup>2</sup> value of .996. Again, since the flow rate was increased at specific increments and the residence time greatly decreased as the flow rate increased initially and then leveled out, **[,--Addressed GS]** it follows that the line of best fit for the height needed for a residence time of 15 minutes should start off with a steeper slope and eventually start to become less steep. By running this experiment and calculating the values needed for residence time and height needed we were able to determine that chains may not be the best material to optimize the parameters wanted, because even at the lowest flow rates the length of the chain needed for an optimal residence time would be very long. **[Why not? My guess is that it was what you had stated earlier that the flow is too low, and the length of chain needed is too long but that should be repeated here if that is the case. Also do not use personal pronouns!-- Addressed GS]**

### Chain Matrix Experiment
The chain matrix experiment focused more on qualitative results rather than quantitative ones. As the experiment ran it was observed that not all of the chains hanging out of the basin in the matrix contained the same amount and flow rate of water. For this reason it was decided to design a different system to distribute water onto the string material.

### Single Dacron String Experiment
The single dacron string experiment yielded the volume of water on the string, the residence time of that volume of water on the string, and the height needed for a 15 minute residence time.

By dividing the mass on the string by the density of water, which is 1 g/ml, the volume of water on the string was obtained. The flow rate was increased in small increments and the volume of water on the string also increased at a specific rate until it reached a certain threshold. This can be seen on the graph in **Figure 18.** as the curve starts to level out as the change in the volume of water on the string decreases as the flow rate increases.

**Figure 18.** The volume of water on the string graphed against the different flow rates (reference manual for code)
</center>

Residence time was calculated by dividing the volume of water on the string (ml) by the flow rate (ml/min) and then converting to seconds. Understanding the residence time of the water on the string at different flow rates is important because time is a constraint in trickling filters. A string digester cannot take too long because it slows the rate of flow the water can come out of the plant at which affects how much wastewater the plant can take in. But, it also cannot run too fast because the bacteria on the string need the right amount of time to actually extract most of the nutrients out of the water. The residence time drastically decreases as the flow rate increases as seen in **Figure 19.**. Thus, it is understood that a string digester would have to run at low flow rates.

The last result the experiment supplied was the height of the string that would be needed for a 15 min residence time at each flow rate. The height needed was calculated by dividing the "optimal" residence time of 15 minutes by the residence time(s)and then  by the length of the chain, in this case .78 meters. **[As-- Addressed GS]** As the flow rate was increased and leveled out **[and leveled out-- Addressed GS]** at specific increments, **[,--Addressed GS]** the residence time greatly decreased, however the height needed for a 15 minute residence time is almost exactly linear (see **Figure 20.**). The length of string needed for a 15 minute residence time at the lowest flow rate of about .0005 mL/s would only be about 1.97 m. By running this experiment and calculating the values needed for residence time and height needed we were able to determine that strings may be a viable option to optimize the parameters we want. The next step would be to design a dispensing system that could actually deliver water onto the strings at such low flow rates.

### Efficiency Analysis of String Digester
``` python
from aguaclara.play import*
# This flow rate was picked as the most feasible flow rate from the Single Dacron Tests
flowRate = 0.0005066666667*u.mL/u.s
#Assuming spacing of 0.5 cm between strings in all directions for 1 m^2
strings1D = 1*u.s / 0.005*u.m
strings2D = strings1D**2
flowRatePerMeter2 = strings2D*flowRate
flowRatePerMeter2.to(u.L/(u.min*u.m**2))
#See Manual for purchase of Dacron Strings, unitCost is in $/100 yard
unitCost = 0.1/u.yard
unitCost.to(1/u.m)
#Height of digester for chosen flow rate, see Single Dacron Experiments
height = 1.948931507*u.m
totalStringLength = strings2D*height
totalCost = totalStringLength*unitCost

#Strings spaced 0.2 cm apart in all directions
strings1D = strings1D = 1*u.s / 0.002*u.m
strings2D = strings1D**2
flowRatePerMeter2 = strings2D*flowRate
flowRatePerMeter2.to(u.L/(u.min*u.m**2))
totalStringLength = strings2D*height
totalCost = totalStringLength*unitCost
```
We found the total cost of the strings per m<sup>2</sup> to be about $\frac{\$7128}{m^2}$ for the strings spaced 0.5 cm apart and treat 1.216 $\frac{L}{min*m^2}$. For the strings spaced 0.2 cm apart, we found the cost to be $\frac{\$44552}{m^2}$ and treat 7.6 $\frac{L}{min*m^2}$. The 0.5 cm spacing filter falls in the range of wetting of 0.6 - 2.4 $\frac{L}{min*m^2}$ that was suggested by the EPA for low rate trickling filters made of rock. The 0.2 cm spaced string digester can maintain a higher flow than this wetting rate. Both of the costs are below the construction costs summarized in Table 2. The flow rate capacities of both of these matrixes is lower than the suggested wetting rate described by Farmer for BOD and NOD removal trickling filters systems.


### Capillary Action with Dacron String
This experiment did not go as expected. The red dye only traveled part of the way down the strings (**Figure 21**). No water made it to the end of the strings; therefore, the weight measurements were not useful as they were all constant. The team hypothesizes that this is because the solution of red dye and water had to travel too far and thus dried up too quickly.

### Capillary Action with Grouped Strings Experiment
The grouped strings carried out capillary action. The weight of the water released from the strings at various times were recorded and graph as a function of time. From this information, the flow rates at these times were calculated by adjusting the weight to be only the amount gained at each time interval. The weight of water that traveled through the strings over time followed a polynomial trend (Figure 22) with the flow rate decreasing over time (Figure 23). In addition, the residence time on the strings also decreased (Figure 24).

### Single Aramid Rope Experiment
Water actually flowed down the string pretty uniformly and slowly. It also appeared that water was being absorbed in the interior of the rope. Because of these results, the team will conduct quantitative tests on this rope.

## Conclusions

The team tested the weight of water on the jack chain at different flow rates using a single chain set-up. From these results, the team was able to determine the amount of water on the chain, the residence time on the chain, and the height needed for a 15 minute residence time. As flow rate increased, the volume of water on the chain and height of chain needed for a 15 minute residence time also increased. The residence time versus flow rate showed a negative correlation. These chains are not a viable option for an AguaClara wastewater treatment plant at this point for reasons explained below **[for reasons explained below -- Addressed ZS]**. At the lowest flow rate tested of 1.5 ml/min onto one single chain, the height needed for a 15 min residence time would be 13.7 m. This is about 4.5 stories. Since the goal of AguaClara is to be gravity powered, it would be quite difficult to get water 13.7 m high. In addition, the difficulty the operators would face should they need to fix something in a string digester this high is not realistic. This chain is also not feasible for an ideal string digester as the water flowing down it did not form a uniform sheath but instead flowed down in distinct droplets. This irregular ebb and flow along with a non-uniform sheath make for a system that does not use the entirety of the surface area of the chain. Since the goal of the string digester is to maximize surface area and therefore digestion efficiency, the inefficient spacial chain digester system is not a feasible option at this time.

The Dacron string seems to have potential as a material for a string digester. In the Single Dacron String Experiment, it was found that for a 15 minute residence time at the lowest flow rate of about .0005 mL/s, the length of the string would need to be 1.97 m. This appears to be much more feasible than the 13.7m jack chain that would be needed for a 15 minute residence time. In addition, the water flowed down the Dacron string more uniformly than the jack chain, making it a promising option. Capillary action with the group of Dacron strings worked well, but there is concern that preferential flow occurred during this experiment. When water droplets were released from the string and into the basin, water was only coming off of a few strings, rather than all of them. This concern will need to be analyzed further in order to determine whether it is a viable option or not. In addition, a matrix of dacron strings theoretically has the capacity to treat water at the same or higher rate than current rock low-rate trickling filters per unit area. However, the closely spaced strings may create difficulties in maintaining the filter should a string break. These low rate filters have a higher BOD removal rate (80-90%) compared to high rate filters (65-85%) (from Table 1). While the wetting rate capacity may not be as high for this string matrix that Farmer described, the string digester aims to be more efficient and therefore remove more BOD.


Creating a rapid but efficient string digester would be impactful for the future of AguaClara's involvement in wastewater treatment ~~.~~ **[because]** String digesters have the potential to greatly decrease the wastewater processing time and also decrease the organic solutes in the effluent. By maximizing potential surface area for the microbes to grow on using strings and sponges, thereby allowing for more microbial digestion of the water, some traditional trickling filter problems would be solved or minimized. Effluent from the UASB will require further treatment and the team believes that a string digester could provide the necessary treatment with minimal energy requirements.



## Future Work
Next semester, the team will continue to run tests with  0.3mm Dacron strings. Capillary action tests will be run with synthetic wastewater to test for biofilm growth and preferential pathways. The team will also begin testing Aramid ropes. Micro-tubing with the peristaltic pump will be used to test the same parameters as was tested for the single chains and single strings. The micro-tubing will allow a much smaller flow rate necessary for the thinner string. In addition, the team will purchase several more strings that are synthetic hydrophilic materials. Further, the rate of oxygen diffusion into the string will be calculated to assure that enough can diffuse into the surface of the string to reach the necessary biological oxygen demand (BOD). **[It is necessary to perform BOD? I don't know what this sentence is saying...--Addressed GS]** . The future of this team primary relies on finding an appropriate material that will allow for biofilm growth and not be susceptible to degrading.

In addition, the team will also have to figure out a way to efficiently create a matrix with the strings and have an even distribution system.

Finally, the team is also looking into using synthetic waste water inoculated with an aerobic bacteria. The team would need to set-up a system of measuring how much organic nutrients the bacteria could remove over the length of the string digester and even just how feasible biofilm growth is on the strings. BOD and NOD removal rates and loading rates would need to be compared to current trickling filter technologies to determine if the string digester is ultimately more space and cost efficient and therefore favorable.
