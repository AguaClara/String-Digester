## Abstract
The objective of String Digester for the Spring 2019 semester is to continue research on revamping a wastewater treatment system to eliminate problems associated with current trickling filters. To improve consistency in wastewater treatment, experiments will be conducted using metallic and plastic chains to optimize surface area. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater. These tests will involve different chain types and materials, chain spacing, and biofilm growth to help define design parameters for the construction of a functioning string digester.

## Introduction
The String Digester sub-team was created in response to the remaining need for secondary wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. A trickling filter is a secondary wastewater treatment system that removes organic matter from the wastewater through biological means, and is crucial for the removal of harmful pathogens. Looking to improve on the traditional industrial-scale trickling filter design, previous work identified an issue with the process: there is a substantial amount of unused space in the trickling treatment unit due to the uneven flow of wastewater across the system (preferential flow). The primary objective of this sub-team is to continue to develop a novel design for a highly efficient trickling filter with a minimized footprint in terms of space. Following the conclusion from Fall 2018, that metal chains would be a viable trickling media due to their retention of water, the team decided to focus this semester's research on trying to determine what material and type of chain would work best in terms of water retention and biofilm growth and from there, determining the best matrix for these chains to be in to maximize water retention on chain media. With this work, the team will work towards assessing the feasibility of a modified trickling filter unit in future AguaClara treatment plants while striving to make significant technological improvements on industry-standard applications for the system.

Research dealing with trickling filter wastewater treatment was ubiquitous in the 1970's and 1980's, however, the research has significantly declined in general trickling filter wastewater treatment research in following decades. Moreover, research involving string as a media in this method of treatment is almost nonexistent. Research on secondary wastewater treatment originally focused on performance of trickling filters, but now has shifted towards processes higher in energy consumption. The plant philosophy of AguaClara is to create a plant that is optimized for low cost and a high performance, and looking at the regions a future wastewater plant would serve, trickling filters are a promising technology due to their low-energy requirements. With work in reducing unused space in these plants, these treatment systems are ideal. Maintaining will be a priority in the team's future design. With modification, the trickling filter treatment system carries much potential to be implemented in areas of the world in which capital expenditure is a major barrier for employing traditional secondary wastewater treatment (aeration tanks).


## Literature Review
### Trickling Filters
The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and preferential flow occurs. Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused. This leads to a less efficient treatment of organic matter than if all of the space in the filter were utilized. In their paper, Spuhler recommends using specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation & allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018).](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215)

In addition to non-homogenous distribution of wastewater throughout the filter, there is significant documentation of other problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. Ali and co-authors state that one major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not addressed, the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims to avoid the problem altogether by using chains and having a media that will not clog up. It is still an important factor to consider in the design because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system will likely clog up with biofilm growth. [Good job explaining thus far]

Ali also states that the aforementioned sloughing and clogging is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Hydraulic loading rate is the amount of flow arriving at the treatment plant and going entering the treatment process at any given time. [What is HLR?]Uneven HLR is caused by clogging of the distribution arm and an uneven distribution of influent. Therefore, proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of influent distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors consist of moving parts that require more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. Additionally, this system will not serve the chain-focused design.

The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system as seen below, utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the medium and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector[diagram to help visualize would be helpful]. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a chain media. However, Sperling and colleagues showed that both the fixed and rotating distribution systems have an inconsistent hydraulic load of the influent [(Sperling 2007)](https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402123.pdf). Therefore, the distribution system is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.

Figure 1: Trickling filter with a fixed distribution system.

Although there are multiple problems with trickling filters, one main advantage of trickling filters is that they have a relatively low residence time. This is a consideration which the team should plan to maintain in future designs. Hinton and Stensel measured residence time per unit length of between 30 and 40 sec/m with dye tests. Their predicted residence times, calculated from laminar flow theory, were closer to about 15 sec/m. The authors attributed this discretion to "dye sorption and desorption by the biofilm." In either case, the residence time for a 5 meter deep trickling filter would be well under 5 minutes [(Hinton and Stensel 1991)](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135491901179/1-s2.0-0043135491901179-main.pdf?_tid=e8d2db22-8e0f-4d3c-a421-352ef74e6f5e&acdnat=1540500088_4808114af12660c061fbd139ac0fbd33). This short treatment time makes trickling filters an appealing wastewater treatment option if problems such as uneven HLR and clogging can be minimized. [Include what the implication of low residence times are, assumedly fast treatment of wastewater]


### Biofilm
A component of the string digester that is crucial to its success is the growth of biofilm on the chains. "A biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells that is irreversibly associated (not removed by gentle rinsing) with a surface and enclosed in a matrix of primarily polysaccharide material." [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) Biofilm attachment is a complex process regulated by diverse characteristics of the growth medium, substratum, and cell surface. Biofilm on trickling filters are composed of a variety of organisms and are typically enclosed in a polysaccharide. The biofilm matrix may also contain mineral crystals, corrosion particles, and clay or silt particles. Biofilms in wastewater systems are often highly complex [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)

Some testing has been done of the growth of biofilm in different surfaces. One study compared growth on glossy electro-polished, bright annealed stainless steel to matte stainless steel and to PVC. The paper notes that stainless steel is hydrophilic and PVC is hydrophobic. In the last 45 days of the 167 day experiment, the matte steel had about 1.44 times more microorganisms than the electro-polished steel, and there was no significant difference between the PVC and polished steel. In discussion of why this occurs, Pedersen cites two reasons: "detachment due to shear forces from the flow will be reduced on the rougher surface since cells can be shielded from the bulk flow and more substratum surface area may be available for the biofilm" [(Pedersen 1990).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) [Translate pedersen!]


In another experiment, three different types of plastic often used in pipe production were investigated for biofilm formation. These materials were PVC, PEX, and HDPE. After two years of system operation, which included weekly pipeline flushing, biofilm analyses were taken. It was found that the PEX pipe had the highest number of bacteria growing (1.15*10<sup>3</sup> $\frac{CFU}{cm^2}$; CFU: colony-forming unit), HDPE pipes had two times less the amount of bacteria (451 $\frac{CFU}{cm^2}$), and PVC surfaces had a significantly lower bacteria count (193 $\frac{CFU}{cm^2}$). [Maybe a table for these values would make this easier to read]However, the number of microorganisms found in the pipes was not related to the number of mineral deposits found, as HDPE pipes had the thickest biofilms with bacteria attached to mineral deposits or immersed in exopolymers. Bacteria did not form large aggregates on PEX surfaces, and PVC biofilm was only made of single cells and did not have any mineral deposits. It was concluded that the ranking of susceptibility to biofilm growth and colonization was HDPE, PEX, and PVC respectively. [(A. Rożej et al., 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4282696/)


Studies have also been conducted about the bacteria that produce the biofilm on the stainless steel. Many of these studies involve curli-producing bacteria. Curli fibers "are the major proteinaceous component of a complex extracellular matrix produced by many Enterobacteriaceae" and "are involved in adhesion to surfaces, cell aggregation, and biofilm formation" [(Barnhart and Chapman).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2838481/) One such study focused on *Escherichia coli* O157:H7 bacteria with 6 individual strains, three of which produced curli and three which did not. The study found that the gene for curli production did not affect the attachment of the bacteria to the stainless steel, but it did affect the formation of biofilms. Only the curli producing strains were able to form biofilms [(Ryu et al. 2004).](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2004.01591.x) However, since *E. coli* are ~~fairly~~ common[ly] [found] in wastewater, it is probable for biofilm to be able to grow on the stainless steel chains as long as some kind of bacteria with the curli-producing gene is present in the wastewater and the flow rate is not too fast. So, assuming that the bacteria will most likely be present and once the biofilm is built up on each of the chains, the main issue then becomes preventing accumulated biofilm from falling off one chain and then dragging it off other chains as well in a domino effect[and then, in a domino effect, dragging it off other chains as well].

## Previous Works
[Would recommend putting this after lit review so that you can introduce concepts/terms unfamiliar to the author before previous work like preferential flow and etc.]
### Spring 2018
In Spring 2018, the Trickling Filter team spent a substantial amount of time doing research on the operational difficulties, the kinetics, and typical design parameters of trickling filters. The team aimed to address many of the issues plant operators encounter with trickling filters, like clogging and ponding, lack of moisture in parts of the filter, and general inefficiency of the filter. The two main areas for improvement the team identified were the filter media itself and the distribution system ([Spring 2018 Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/String-Digester/blob/master/Spring%20'18/TricklingFilter_Final_Report.md)).



The team fabricated a bench top model for flow mapping and conducted several rounds of tests to determine the distribution of flow in trickling filters with small rock and marble media. From these experiments, the team noticed that there were significant portions of the media that never got wet and thus concluded that a substantial volume of the trickling filter was unused due to preferential flow. From these tests the team also showed that a uniform packing material is superior to an irregularly shaped material. In an effort to both maximize the surface area to volume ratio and to minimize the footprint of the system by not wasting space, the team shifted focus towards strings as a possible filter media. This concept led the team to start with very preliminary testing of a system that was essentially an overflowing basin with strings submerged at the top, inside the basin, and draped over the sides to guide water down to a collection bucket below. (See Figure 12 in section 1.2.2 in  [Can include that figure 2 mentioned here too!] for an example of  experimental set-up similar to those conducted in Spring 2018.) In these initial tests, the team members observed that the water did in fact follow the along strings when it overflowed. From these observations, the String Digester team began to design more rigorous tests on the concept and planned to investigate whether using strings in a wastewater treatment system is truly viable.

</center>

### Fall 2018
In Fall 2018, the team continued experimentation with the overflowing basin from the previous semester. The string yarn was abandoned due to its degradability. Nylon, polypropylene, and a stainless steel wire and cable were first tested on the same set-up from Spring 2018 with the overflowing basin. The plastics were chosen for their non-biodegradability; however, the stainless steel wires may be susceptible to corrosion. All of the preceding [preceding? or aforementioned] materials did not perform well on the basin set-up as the water did not follow the strands due to their hydrophobicity.


Next, two foams and two stainless steel chains were tested on the same basin in addition to a winged basin set up. These materials were able to retain water as it trickled down. The blue foam worked exceptionally well as it absorbed water. The initial testing done on these materials suggests they could work in the proposed system and make the string digester technology possible. Further testing will be done on the chains as the foams are thought to easily clog; therefore, they are not confirmed to be a viable solution at this point. See [Fall 2018 Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/String-Digester/blob/master/Fall%20'18/Final_Report_stringdigester.md) for more information.

## Methods

### Initial experiment

##### Objective of Experiment
The objective of the initial experiment was to determine the amount of water that could be held on the chain at a single point in time and to figure out how long the residence time was for water on the chain at different flow rates.

####Experimental Apparatus
A scale was secured approximately one meter above a lab bench resting on supports at each corner so that the bottom of the scale was left accessible. There was a hook on the bottom of the scale that measures the weight that is hung from the hook. A single chain was attached to the hook on the bottom of the scale and was allowed to hang down freely, see Figure 1 below. Reference the Manual section for a detailed explanation of the set-up.

* Materials (dimensions, materials)
* Complications in construction
* If already constructed: write a brief summary of important constraints, include any revisions to apparatus, also reference the prior report where construction is described

#### Procedure
[Reference the Manual section for detailed procedure]. A narrow tube was connected to a peristaltic pump and water was pumped at a known rate. The end of the tube was directed onto the top of the chain hanging from the scale, in an attempt to allow water to flow onto and down the hanging chain. The scale was zeroed with the chain hanging on the scale so that the scale would only measure the weight of the water on the chain. The idea was to get water flowing on the chain and then, while continuously pumping water onto the chain, measure the weight of the water on the chain at a moment in time. Because the scale reading often fluctuated, the range of weights was recorded. The weight of the water on the chain was found for several different flow rates of water from the peristaltic pump. From these measurements, the team would be able to quantify how much water the chain could hold per unit length. ** add residence time thing**?

### Chain Matrix Experiment
#####Objective of Experiment
The objective of this chain matrix experiment was to identify and compare the water retention of multiple chains in the same basin of water.


#### Experimental Apparatus
6 holes were drilled into a basin(see Figure 2). 6 chains were subsequently inserted into these holes and were left to hang freely from the other end(see Figure 3). The basin was placed on top of a rod that rested across from the four supports in the previous experiment(see Figure 4). Reference the Manual section for detailed information on the Experimental Apparatus.

#### Procedure
Water from a narrow tube was directed into the basin. The peristaltic pump was used to control the amount of water flowing into the basin. The amount of water flowing onto each chain was analyzed and compared for retention.

## Results and Analysis
The single chain experiment yielded many results by simply measuring the mass and length of the chain at a controlled flow rate. By dividing the mass on the chain by the density of water, which is 1 g/ml, we were able to obtain the volume of water on the chain. When graphed against flow rate this calculation yielded a curve best fit by a power series with an R<sup>2</sup> of .991. This is an appropriate result because power series are most often used for data that compares measurements that increase at a specific rate. The flow rate was increased in small increments and it makes sense that the volume of water on the chain would also increase at a specific rate until it reached a certain threshold, which can be seen towards the end of the line graph where the volume of water on the chain starts leveling out.

Figure 2: The volume of water on the chain when the pump is running at different flow rates

Furthermore, residence time was calculated by dividing the volume of water on the chain (ml) by the flow rate(ml/min) and then multiplying by 60 sec/min to get the value in a more feasible and understandable unit. Understanding the residence time of water at different flow rates is important because optimally the residence time desired is 15 minutes. Again, since the flow rate is increasing in small increments a power series is used for a line of best fir curve, this time with an R<sup>2</sup> value of .996. Since the residence time drastically decreases as the flow rate increases it is understood that an actual string digester system made with chains would have to run at low flow rates with really long chains. For example, if it were run at 1.5 ml/min at least a 13.716-meter chain would be needed for the optimal 15-minute residence time, which might be unattainable in some circumstances and the issue of clogging of pipes and tubes comes into play because the flow rate is so low. Thus, other materials may be worth looking into as possible strings in the system that will have better residence time.

Figure 3: The residence time of water on the chain when the pump is running at different flow rates

Another result the experiment supplied was the height of the chain that would be needed for a 15 min residence time at each flow rate. The height needed was calculated by dividing 900 seconds (15 mins) by the residence time(s) by the length of the chain, in this case .9144 meters. Then in graphing this value against the flow rate another set of data with a power series line of best fit is yielded this time with a R<sup>2</sup> value of .996. Again, since the flow rate was increased at specific increments and the residence time greatly decreased as the flow rate increased initially and then leveled out it follows that the line of best fit for the height needed for a residence time of 15 minutes should start off with a steeper slope and eventually start to become less steep. By running this experiment and calculating the values needed for residence time and height needed we were able to determine that chains may not be the best material to optimize the parameters we want.

Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python

y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions

The team tested the tested the weight of water on the jack chain at different flow rates using a single chain set-up. From these results, the team was able to determine the amount of water on the chain, the residence time on the chain, and the height needed for a 15 minute residence time. As flow rate increased, the volume of water on the chain and height of chain needed for a 15 minute residence time also increased. The residence time versus flow rate showed a negative correlation. These chains do not show a viable option for an AguaClara wastewater treatment plant at this point. At the lowest flow rate tested of 1.5 ml/min onto one single chain, the height needed for a 15 min residence time would be 13.7 m. This is about 4.5 stories. Since the goal of AguaClara is to be gravity powered, it would be quite difficult to get water 13.7 m high in addition to the difficulty the operators would face should they need to fix something in a string digester this high. In addition, this chain is also not feasible for an ideal string digester as the water flowing down it did not form a uniform sheath but instead flowed down in distinct droplets. This irregular ebb and flow along with a non-uniform sheath make for a system that does not use the entirety of the surface area of the chain. Since the goal of the string digester is to maximize surface area and therefore digestion efficiency, the inefficient spacial chain digester system is not a feasible option at this time.

Creating a rapid but efficient string digester would be impactful for the future of AguaClara's involvement in wastewater treatment. String digesters have the potential to greatly decrease the wastewater processing time and also decrease the organic solutes in the effluent. By maximizing potential surface area for the microbes to grow on using strings and sponges, thereby allowing for more microbial digestion of the water, some traditional trickling filter problems would be solved or minimized. Effluent from the UASB will require further treatment and the team believes that a string digester could provide the necessary treatment with minimal energy requirements.

## Future Work
In the following weeks, the team will test a 0.3mm Dacron string. The team will use micro-tubing with the peristaltic pump to test the same parameters as was tested for the chains. The micro-tubing will allow a much smaller flow rate necessary for the thinner string. In addition, the team will purchase several more strings that are synthetic hydrophilic materials. The team may also test the capillary action abilities of the strings to draw water up at an even slower rate. Further, the rate of oxygen diffusion into the string will be calculated to assure that enough can diffuse into the surface of the string to reach the necessary biological oxygen demand (BOD). This BOD is necessary to perform as a successful alternative to a trickling filter and remove organic compounds. The future of this team primary relies on finding an appropriate material that will allow for biofilm growth and not be susceptible to degrading.

The team is also looking into using synthetic waste water inoculated with an aerobic bacteria. The team would need to set-up a system of measuring how much organic nutrients the bacteria could remove over the length of the string digester and even just how feasible biofilm growth is on the strings.
