## Abstract
The objective of String Digester for the Spring 2019 semester is to continue research on revamping a wastewater treatment system to eliminate problems associated with current trickling filters. To improve consistency in wastewater treatment, experiments will be conducted using metallic and plastic chains to optimize surface area. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater. These tests will involve different chain types and materials, chain spacing, and biofilm growth to help define design parameters for the construction of a functioning string digester.

## Introduction
Explain how the completion of your challenge will affect AguaClara and the mission of providing safe drinking water (or sustainable wastewater treatment!). If this is a continuing team, how will your contribution build upon previous research? What needs to be further discovered or defined? If this is a new team, what prompted the inclusion of this team?

## Previous Works
### Spring 2018
In Spring 2018, the Trickling Filter team spent a substantial amount of time doing research and gathering information on the operational difficulties, the kinetics, and typical design parameters of trickling filters. The team aimed to address many of the issues plant operators encounter with trickling filters, like clogging and ponding, lack of moisture in parts of the filter, and general inefficiency of the filter. The two main areas for improvement the team identified were the filter media itself and the distribution system ([Spring 2018 Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/String-Digester/blob/master/Spring%20'18/TricklingFilter_Final_Report.md)).
### Fall 2018


The team fabricated a bench top model for flow mapping and conducted several rounds of tests to determine the distribution of flow in trickling filters with small rock and marble media. From these experiments, the team noticed that there were significant portions of the media that never got wet and thus concluded that a substantial volume of the trickling filter was unused due to preferential flow. From these tests the team also showed that a uniform packing material is superior to an irregularly shaped material. In an effort to both maximize the surface area to volume ratio and to minimize the footprint of the system by not wasting space, the team shifted focus towards strings as a possible filter media. This concept led the team to start with very preliminary testing of a system that was essentially an overflowing basin with strings submerged at the top, inside the basin, and draped over the sides to guide water down to a collection bucket below. (See Figure 2 in section 1.2.2 for an example of  experimental set-up similar to those conducted in Spring 2018.) In these initial tests, the team members observed that the water did in fact follow the along strings when it overflowed. From these observations, the String Digester team began to design more rigorous tests on the concept and planned to investigate whether using strings in a wastewater treatment system is truly viable.

## Literature Review
### Trickling Filters
The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and preferential flow occurs. Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused. This leads to a less efficient treatment of organic matter than if all of the space in the filter were utilized. In their paper, Spuhler recommends using specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation & allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018).](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215)

In addition to non-homogenous distribution of wastewater throughout the filter, there is significant documentation of other problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. Ali and co-authors state that one major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not addressed, the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims avoid the problem altogether by using strings and not having a media that can clog up. It is still an important factor to consider in the design because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system will likely clog up with biofilm growth.

Ali also states that the aforementioned sloughing and clogging is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Uneven HLR is caused by clogging of the distribution arm and an uneven distribution of influent. Therefore, proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of influent distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors consist of moving parts that require more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. Additionally, this system will not serve the string-focused design.

The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system, utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the medium and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a string media. However, Sperling and colleagues showed that both the fixed and rotating distribution systems have an inconsistent hydraulic load of the influent [(Sperling 2007)](https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402123.pdf). Therefore, the distribution system is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.


Although there are multiple problems with trickling filters, one main advantage of trickling filters is that they have a relatively low residence time. This is a consideration which the team should plan to maintain in future designs. Hinton and Stensel measured residence time per unit length of between 30 and 40 sec/m with dye tests. Their predicted residence times, calculated from laminar flow theory, were closer to about 15 sec/m. The authors attributed this discretion to "dye sorption and desorption by the biofilm." In either case, the residence time for a 5 meter deep trickling filter would be well under 5 minutes [(Hinton and Stensel 1991)](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135491901179/1-s2.0-0043135491901179-main.pdf?_tid=e8d2db22-8e0f-4d3c-a421-352ef74e6f5e&acdnat=1540500088_4808114af12660c061fbd139ac0fbd33). This short treatment time makes trickling filters an appealing wastewater treatment option if problems such as uneven HLR and clogging can be minimized.

### Trickling Filter Alternatives
Downward Hanging Sponge (DHS) Reactors are another form of treating wastewater. They have a similar mechanism as trickling filters. Water is distributed onto sponges and water trickles down through and on the sponges due to gravity. Biofilm grows within and on the sponge and removes organic nutrients from the wastewater as it trickles down. Onodera and co-authors found the advantages of DHS include: high biomass concentration, high sludge residence time, low hydraulic retention time, small footprint. There are six generations of the DHS reactor. The different generations are different sizes and geometries of sponges including sponge cubes, curtain long triangular sponge strips on a plastic sheet, sponge packing unit in net-like plastic, and the most recent generation: a rigid sponge from a mix of polyurethane and epoxy resin. Polyurethane was shown to support microorganism growth and retain water [(Onodera 2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24291312). In addition, the high porosity of the sponge enhances diffusion of air into the wastewater, and maintains an dissolved oxygen at level higher than necessary for aerobes. This way, no extra aeration is necessary for the system compared to traditional aerobic treatment systems [(M. Tandukar et al., 2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16180445).

DHS reactors are an appealing alternative to traditional trickling filters as they overcome some problems. One problem DHS overcomes is a low sludge residence time. This is because micro-organisms can grow both inside and on the surface of the sponge. This also optimizes the space. The DHS was also shown to have lower excess sludge than the traditional trickling filter. Onodera and co-authors showed that DHS reactors are a viable secondary treatment post USAB and that sponges have much potential in treating wastewater [(Onodera 2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24291312).

### Biofilm
A component of the string digester that is crucial to its success is the biofilm. "A biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells that is irreversibly associated (not removed by gentle rinsing) with a surface and enclosed in a matrix of primarily polysaccharide material." [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) Biofilm attachment is a complex process regulated by diverse characteristics of the growth medium, substratum, and cell surface. Biofilm on trickling filters are composed of a variety of organisms and are typically enclosed in a polysaccharide. The biofilm matrix may also contain mineral crystals, corrosion particles, and clay or silt particles. Biofilms in wastewater systems are often highly complex [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)

Some testing has been done of the growth of biofilm in different surfaces. One study compared growth on glossy electro-polished, bright annealed stainless steel to matte stainless steel and to PVC. The paper notes that stainless steel is hydrophilic and PVC is hydrophobic. In the last 45 days of the 167 day experiment, the matte steel had about 1.44 times more microorganisms than the electro-polished steel, and there was no significant difference between the PVC and polished steel. In discussion of why this occurs, Pedersen cites two reasons: "detachment due to shear forces from the flow will be reduced on the rougher surface since cells can be shielded from the bulk flow and more substratum surface area may be available for the biofilm" [(Pedersen 1990).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)

In another experiment, three different types of plastic often used in pipe production were investigated for biofilm formation. These materials were PVC, PEX, and HDPE. After two years of system operation, which included weekly pipeline flushing, biofilm analyses were taken. It was found that the PEX pipe had the highest number of bacteria growing(1.15*103 CFU cm-2), HDPE pipes had two times less the amount of bacteria(451 CFU cm-2), and PVC surfaces had a significantly lower bacteria count(193 CFU cm-2). However, the number of microorganisms found in the pipes was not related to the number of mineral deposits found, as HDPE pipes had the thickest biofilms with bacteria attached to mineral deposits or immersed in exopolymers. Bacteria did not form large aggregates on PEX surfaces, and PVC biofilm was only made of single cells and did not have any mineral deposits. It was concluded that the ranking of susceptibility to biofilm growth and colonization was HDPE, PEX, and PVC respectively. [(A. Rożej et al., 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4282696/)
