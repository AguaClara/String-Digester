        "The String Digester Spring 2022 subteam continues to research into the use of strings as a filtration medium in an efficient gravity powered trickle filter. This semester, the team is building off of previous work to create a model of sloped layers of loopy strings, with water sprayed evenly on them by a water distributor. Water flowing at 10 Î¼L/s on each string would allow for cleaning by a biofilm. The team will test for preferential flow and even water dispersion, critical for treatment of the secondary and tertiary wastewater entering the string digester. \n"

        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "The String Digester sub-team was created in response to the need for additional wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. A trickling filter is a secondary wastewater treatment system that removes organic matter from the wastewater through biological means, and is crucial for the removal of harmful pathogens. The goal of the String Digester subteam is to design a new trickling filter using strings as media that addresses the expensive and inefficient nature of conventional designs. Current trickling filters utilize a large mechanical distributor arm to spray water onto filter media, which requires periodic maintenance, can clog easily, and distributes water unevenly. Other inefficiencies in trickling filter operation are caused by preferential flow in the filter media itself. \n",
        " \n",
        "When designing a new trickling filter, a priority for the subteam was following the AguaClara philosophy: plants should be designed for low cost, high performance, and accessibility. Eliminating the need for large moving parts such as the distributor arm, would reduce the energy requirements and therefore the cost of a trickling filters. Additionally, decreasing preferential flow in the filter media would improve performance, making trickling filters more competitive with other secondary treatment methods such as aeration tanks. Finally, avoiding the use of small holes susceptible to clogging was an important consideration in the trickling filter design. \n",
        " \n",
        "Strings were chosen as a filter media for several reasons. Their high surface area to volume ratio means that a large amount of water can be treated in a small space. [Research](###String-Reaeration) also shows that strings have the ability to reaerate quickly so that energy-consuming fans are not needed to reintroduce oxygen to the system. Additionally, the subteam believed that the linear geometry of a string could minimize preferential flow. \n",
        " \n",
        "This semester, the team looks to calculate the number of strings required for a model that uses a spoon shaped water distributor to create a good flow, and create an arrangement of those strings that would reduce preferential flow. The string arrangement is important to ensure water is evenly distributed across the total area. "

        "\n",
        "The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and preferential flow occurs. To clarify, preferential flow occurs when water repeatedly follows a specific pathway through the filter media opposed to others. Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused, and this is space ineffeicient. Spuhler recommended using specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation and allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018)](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215).\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to non-homogenous distribution of wastewater throughout the filter, there is significant documentation of other problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. Ali and co-authors stated that one major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not addressed, the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims to avoid the problem altogether by using a media that will not clog, however it is still an important factor to consider in the design, because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system has the potential to clog with biofilm growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ali also stated that the aforementioned sloughing and clogging are often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Hydraulic loading rate is the amount of flow arriving at the treatment plant and entering the treatment process at any given time. Uneven HLR is caused by clogging of the distribution arm and an uneven distribution of influent. Therefore, proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of influent distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors consist of moving parts that require more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. \n",
        "\n",
        "The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system as seen below (**Figure 1**), utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the trickling filter medium and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a string media. However, Sperling and colleagues showed that both the fixed and rotating distribution systems have an inconsistent hydraulic load of the influent [(Sperling 2007)](https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402123.pdf). Therefore, the distribution system is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.\n",

        "Although there are multiple problems with trickling filters, one main advantage of trickling filters is that they have a relatively low residence time. This is a consideration which the team should plan to maintain in future designs. Hinton and Stensel measured residence time per unit length of between 30 and 40 sec/m with dye tests. Their predicted residence times, calculated from laminar flow theory, were closer to about 15 sec/m. The authors attributed this discrepancy to \"dye sorption and desorption by the biofilm.\" In either case, the residence time for a 5 meter deep trickling filter would be well under 5 minutes [(Hinton and Stensel 1991)](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135491901179/1-s2.0-0043135491901179-main.pdf?_tid=e8d2db22-8e0f-4d3c-a421-352ef74e6f5e&acdnat=1540500088_4808114af12660c061fbd139ac0fbd33). This short treatment time makes trickling filters an appealing wastewater treatment option if problems such as uneven HLR and clogging can be minimized.\n",

        "## **Water Distribution**\n",
        "Uniform water distribution is essential for many applications such as irrigation and water treatment. One common method for distributing water over a relatively large area is using a spray. There are several different methods for creating a spray, two being the Fixed Spray Plate Sprinklers (FSPS) and Rotating Spray Plate Sprinklers (RSPS). A comparative study conducted by [Faci et al. (2001)](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9437%282001%29127%3A4%28224%29) found that both methods resulted in a highly uniform distribution, with RSPS slightly more uniform than FSPS (94.6% versus 93.7%). While the study also focused on the effect of wind and overlapping sprinkler arrays, the methods and materials of the sprinklers are more applicable to this report.\n",
        "\n",
        "The FSPS design involves a water jet impinging on a fixed deflector plate, which then sprays water radially outward in the horizontal plane. The RSPS differs in that the deflector plate rotates when hit with the water jet. The nozzle diameters used in the study for both the FSPS and the RSPS were 3.8, 6.7, and 7.9mm. The deflector plate is what creates the spray pattern, and different deflectors can result in sprays at different angles. For the FSPS, the deflector had 33 grooves which resulted in flow being divided into 33 streams for the 3.8mm nozzle. One note from the study was that as the number of grooves in the deflector plate is increased, the drop size (for a set pressure and nozzle diameter) decreases [(Kincaid et al. 1996)](https://elibrary.asabe.org/azdez.asp?JID=3&AID=27568&CID=t1996&v=39&i=3&T=1&refer=7&access=&dabs=Y).\n",
        "\n",
        "For each of the sprinkler types, the distribution pattern was observed in varying wind conditions (low wind and medium wind) and with the sprinkler at different heights (1m and 2.5m) above the ground. Figure 2 shows that the RSPS results in a distribution with the highest density at the center (directly under the sprinkler) with the water density decreasing gradually as the radius from the center increases. However the FSPS results in a maximum density in a circular crown several meters from the center where the sprinkler is located. This difference in precipitation patterns is caused by the variation in the size of droplets from an RSPS (which can travel a wide range of distances depending on droplet diameter) compared with the relatively uniform droplet size from an FSPS.\n",

As the sprinkler height from the ground increases, the total wetted area increases as drops emitted in the horizontal direction are able to travel a longer distance. However, drops traveling further have a tendency to drift or evaporate causing less uniformity in the sprinkler distribution, especially at higher wind speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "While sprinklers create a uniform spray pattern that can be manipulated by varying parameters such as droplet size, nozzle diameter, and sprinkler height, sprinklers also require small orifices and large water velocities which may not be feasible with wastewater and potential clogging from biofilm growth. However the methods used to spray water outward in the radial direction could be useful when designing a system to spray water in a specific pattern, such as a straight line, and the methods used to split a water stream into several smaller jets may be applicable to future string digester designs.\n",

A more recent [source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283744445_Global_Wastewater_and_Sludge_Production_Treatment_and_Use) from 2015 reported a municipal wastewater production of 330 km^3.

The research in the above paragraph supports this estimate, as the calculated values are on the same order of magnitude.

        "For the digester designs, the \"drilled hole\" design shows some promise. While this design showed  If holes could be drilled in a steady pattern, it would be a relatively quick way to string the walls, especially if a needle was used to quickly pass through the holes. A larger pipe could potentially be used, allowing for multiple walls of string to be hung from the same rod. \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, for this design a plan to pump water though each individual PVC pipe, instead of using the spray distributor, was devised. The top pipe would have a closed off end so all water would have to travel through the drilled holes. From there, water would trickle down from each of the strings. However, this idea was rejected as the small holes could get clogged by particles in the water. \n",
        "\n",
        "Nonetheless, this design could still work with a spray distributor. Some potential problems include difficulties in drilling every hole in an even line. Also, it would be ideal if the pipe was smaller - 5mm in diameter, however that would require a different material than PVC pipe. A way to space the walls apart could be to have multiple walls strung through each pipe, if a pipe of a diameter much larger than 5 mm was used. \n",
        "\n",
        "The threaded rod design did not work as well. The biggest problem was the string slipping from the positions, leading to cross over and not keeping the required 5 mm distance between strings. Perhaps if the threading was more pronounced, the strings would stay in place better. "

The spoon distributor appeared to produce a satisfactory spray in preliminary trials.  Investigation into the optimal height to position it under falling water will be necessary moving forward. \n",

        "In addition, finding a suitable material to use for the rods is a priority. Ideally, a material would have a diameter of 5 mm and be easy to drill through. However, one consideration to keep in mind is that if a larger PVC pipe were used, of say 25 mm, then multiple walls of string could potentially be included on one rod. \n",
        "\n",
        "One aspect of the string digester that has been largely ignored in research thus far is the biofilm. Investigation into the creation of an ideal biofilm to be present on the strings will be important once a digester design is accepted and built."
