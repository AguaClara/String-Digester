        "The String Digester Fall 2019 subteam continued research on designing a new trickling filter to eliminate problems associated with conventional designs. The team developed an improved model of the previous model that used materials that do not decay as quickly. Experiments this fall focused on designing a water distribution system that does not encourage preferential flow, and creating a matrix of strings using \"loopy yarn\" as the filter media. An ideal string digester would distribute water uniformly onto a large number of densely packed strings from a spray. Previous testing demonstrated that a \"good\" spray can be achieved with flow rates on the order of 10 μL/s per string, which is the amount needed to ensure proper cleaning by a biofilm. Previous testing also found the string density resulting in the least preferential flow to be 30 strings/cm, although more trials are needed to confirm this result. Further experimentation is needed to improve the spray pattern geometry, and to determine if the \"loopy yarn\" is suitable for biofilm growth. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater. "

        "\n",
        "The String Digester sub-team was created in response to the need for additional wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. A trickling filter is a secondary wastewater treatment system that removes organic matter from the wastewater through biological means, and is crucial for the removal of harmful pathogens. The goal of the String Digester subteam is to design a new trickling filter using strings as media that addresses the expensive and inefficient nature of conventional designs. Current trickling filters utilize a large mechanical distributor arm to spray water onto filter media, which requires periodic maintenance, can clog easily, and distributes water unevenly. Other inefficiencies in trickling filter operation are caused by preferential flow in the filter media itself. \n",
        " \n",
        "When designing a new trickling filter, a priority for the subteam was following the AguaClara philosophy: plants should be designed for low cost, high performance, and accessibility. Eliminating the need for large moving parts such as the distributor arm, would reduce the energy requirements and therefore the cost of a trickling filters. Additionally, decreasing preferential flow in the filter media would improve performance, making trickling filters more competitive with other secondary treatment methods such as aeration tanks. Finally, avoiding the use of small holes susceptible to clogging was an important consideration in the trickling filter design. \n",
        " \n",
        "Strings were chosen as a filter media for several reasons. Their high surface area to volume ratio means that a large amount of water can be treated in a small space. [Research](###String-Reaeration) also shows that strings have the ability to reaerate quickly so that energy-consuming fans are not needed to reintroduce oxygen to the system. Additionally, the subteam believed that the linear geometry of a string could minimize preferential flow. \n",
        " \n",
        "The main challenges faced by the subteam are finding a way to distribute a small amount of water evenly onto a large number of strings and ensuring that water is flowing down the strings evenly with the correct flow rate (10 μL/s) so that all the water gets treated fully and there is little to no wasted space. This semester the subteam will continue experimenting with methods for water distribution that do not involve large moving mechanical parts or small orifices that can clog. One concern with strings, as with traditional filter media, is that preferential flow will limit the efficiency of the design. Taking this into account when designing a model will be important, as well as concerns about biofilm growth and treatment. \n",

        "\n",
        "The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and preferential flow occurs. To clarify, preferential flow occurs when water repeatedly follows a specific pathway through the filter media opposed to others.Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused, and this is space ineffeicient. Spuhler recommended using specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation and allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018)](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215).\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to non-homogenous distribution of wastewater throughout the filter, there is significant documentation of other problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. Ali and co-authors stated that one major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not addressed, the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims to avoid the problem altogether by using a media that will not clog, however it is still an important factor to consider in the design, because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system has the potential to clog with biofilm growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ali also stated that the aforementioned sloughing and clogging are often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Hydraulic loading rate is the amount of flow arriving at the treatment plant and entering the treatment process at any given time. Uneven HLR is caused by clogging of the distribution arm and an uneven distribution of influent. Therefore, proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of influent distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors consist of moving parts that require more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. \n",
        "\n",
        "The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system as seen below (**Figure 1**), utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the trickling filter medium and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a string media. However, Sperling and colleagues showed that both the fixed and rotating distribution systems have an inconsistent hydraulic load of the influent [(Sperling 2007)](https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402123.pdf). Therefore, the distribution system is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.\n",

        "Although there are multiple problems with trickling filters, one main advantage of trickling filters is that they have a relatively low residence time. This is a consideration which the team should plan to maintain in future designs. Hinton and Stensel measured residence time per unit length of between 30 and 40 sec/m with dye tests. Their predicted residence times, calculated from laminar flow theory, were closer to about 15 sec/m. The authors attributed this discrepancy to \"dye sorption and desorption by the biofilm.\" In either case, the residence time for a 5 meter deep trickling filter would be well under 5 minutes [(Hinton and Stensel 1991)](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135491901179/1-s2.0-0043135491901179-main.pdf?_tid=e8d2db22-8e0f-4d3c-a421-352ef74e6f5e&acdnat=1540500088_4808114af12660c061fbd139ac0fbd33). This short treatment time makes trickling filters an appealing wastewater treatment option if problems such as uneven HLR and clogging can be minimized.\n",

        "## **Water Distribution**\n",
        "Uniform water distribution is essential for many applications such as irrigation and water treatment. One common method for distributing water over a relatively large area is using a spray. There are several different methods for creating a spray, two being the Fixed Spray Plate Sprinklers (FSPS) and Rotating Spray Plate Sprinklers (RSPS). A comparative study conducted by Faci found that both methods resulted in a highly uniform distribution, with RSPS slightly more uniform than FSPS (94.6% versus 93.7%). While the study also focused on the effect of wind and overlapping sprinkler arrays, the methods and materials of the sprinklers are more applicable to this report [(Faci et al. 2001)](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9437%282001%29127%3A4%28224%29).\n",
        "\n",
        "The FSPS design involves a water jet impinging on a fixed deflector plate, which then sprays water radially outward in the horizontal plane. The RSPS differs in that the deflector plate rotates when hit with the water jet. The nozzle diameters used in the study for both the FSPS and the RSPS were 3.8, 6.7, and 7.9mm. The deflector plate is what creates the spray pattern, and different deflectors can result in sprays at different angles. For the FSPS, the deflector had 33 grooves which resulted in flow being divided into 33 streams for the 3.8mm nozzle. One note from the study was that as the number of grooves in the deflector plate is increased, the drop size (for a set pressure and nozzle diameter) decreases [(Kincaid et al. 1996)](https://elibrary.asabe.org/azdez.asp?JID=3&AID=27568&CID=t1996&v=39&i=3&T=1&refer=7&access=&dabs=Y).\n",
        "\n",
        "For each of the sprinkler types, the distribution pattern was observed in varying wind conditions (low wind and medium wind) and with the sprinkler at different heights (1m and 2.5m) above the ground. Figure 2 shows that the RSPS results in a distribution with the highest density at the center (directly under the sprinkler) with the water density decreasing gradually as the radius from the center increases. However the FSPS results in a maximum density in a circular crown several meters from the center where the sprinkler is located. This difference in precipitation patterns is caused by the variation in the size of droplets from an RSPS (which can travel a wide range of distances depending on droplet diameter) compared with the relatively uniform droplet size from an FSPS.\n",

As the sprinkler height from the ground increases, the total wetted area increases as drops emitted in the horizontal direction are able to travel a longer distance. However, drops traveling further have a tendency to drift or evaporate causing less uniformity in the sprinkler distribution, especially at higher wind speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "While sprinklers create a uniform spray pattern that can be manipulated by varying parameters such as droplet size, nozzle diameter, and sprinkler height, sprinklers also require small orifices and large water velocities which may not be feasible with wastewater and potential clogging from biofilm growth. However the methods used to spray water outward in the radial direction could be useful when designing a system to spray water in a specific pattern, such as a straight line, and the methods used to split a water stream into several smaller jets may be applicable to future string digester designs.\n",

Biofilm on trickling filters is composed of a variety of organisms and are typically enclosed in a polysaccharide. The biofilm matrix may also contain mineral crystals, corrosion particles, and clay or silt particles. In conclusion, biofilms in wastewater systems are often highly complex [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)\n",

In the last 45 days of the 167 day experiment, the matte steel had about 1.44 times more microorganisms than the electro-polished steel, and there was no significant difference between the PVC and polished steel. In discussion of why this occurs, Pedersen cites two reasons: \"detachment due to shear forces from the flow will be reduced on the rougher surface since cells can be shielded from the bulk flow and more substratum surface area may be available for the biofilm\" [(Pedersen 1990).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)\n",

        "For strings to be a viable filter media in a string digester, the wastewater being treated must be exposed to a sufficient amount of oxygen. This is because biofilms consume oxygen in the process of breaking down organic material. Whether reaeration occurs as water flows slowly down a string is an important question Krasnoff and Lee answered in their report [Potential Aeration of Water Trickling Down a String](https://github.com/monroews/CEE3530/blob/master/Projects/2019/1Project.pdf). The experiments performed in this investigation into the aeration of water as it flows down a string included testing two different types of string - a flat string and a loopy yarn. By observing dissolved oxygen (DO) levels for varying amounts of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from $Na_{2}SO_{3}$, it was concluded that aeration can occur when water trickles down both the flat string and the loopy yarn. \n",
        "\n",
        "A second set of trials where the COD level was kept constant at 200 mg/L tested the aeration potential at three different flow rates. As expected the slowest flow rate resulted in the highest levels of DO since the water had the most time for aeration to occur on the string. In each case, the loopy yarn had higher levels of DO and it was shown that the loopy yarn still allowed for significant aeration at high flow rates whie the flat string did not (reaeration of the loopy yarn occurred for flow rates ranging from 1.75 to 17.2 μL/s). This means the loopy yarn is a more promising string digester filter media because a higher flow rate will increase the efficiency of the reactor without sacrificing the treatment. The higher rate of aeration in the yarn is attributed to it being hydrophilic and having \"loops\" that allow water drops to briefly collect. Because of this decreased flow rate and ability to reaerate, the loopy yarn was chosen over other materials tested by previous subteams (See [Previous Work](#Previous-work) for more details on these materials) to be used in Summer 2019 experiments. \n",
        "\n",
        "The results from these experiments showed that strings have the ability to reaerate naturally as water flows down them without needing an external source of air movement, such as with a fan. The type of string, the flow rate, and the level of COD are other variables that were proven to impact the degree of aeration and further tests with these parameters in mind would potentially lead to an ideal material and flowrate to consider for a working wastewater treatment plant. While the loopy yarn is promising in lab conditions, the biodegradability of acrylic yarn is something to consider. Under the conditions of a string digester, each strand of filter media will need to withstand a near constant flow of wastewater as well as host a biofilm for proper treatment. Further research into the effects of biofilm growth on several materials with the same \"loopy\" properties as the yarn will be needed."

The research in the above paragraph supports this estimate, as the calculated values are on the same order of magnitude.

As the number of strands per string increases, the flow rate increases and consequently the length required for a suitable residence time increases. The distance the water must travel to the top of the vertical portion of the strings influences the flow rate of water down the strings because the rate at which water rises to the top of the strings via capillary action depends on the water pressure in the reservoir. This means that the height of water in the reservoir, which is a basin that holds the untreated water, and the distance between the surface of the water to the top of the strings have an effect on the flow rate and the length of the strings. \n",

The team used a tall and thin water column elevated above their lab bench to create enough pressure through the tubing leading up to the spray device to create the optimal spray. After designing a spray system the team tested the flow rates by seeing how long it took for water to run out of the tube and into a 100 mL graduated cylinder. From this the subteam determined a total flow rate of 14.5 mL/s In order for each string to have a flow rate of 10 𝜇L/s the total flow rate would need to be directed onto a matrix of about 1500 strings and in order to produce clean wastewater at 1 L/s a total of about 1 million \n",

This means creating a spray that is the same width as the wall of strings in the model so there is no excess water sprayed, which could influence the flow down the strings and would have to be collected and then treated. In previous semesters, the team attempted to limit the width of the spray using curved (half-pipe) deflectors and trying to set the width of the spray using additional pipes that would collect any excess water. However, a problem with limiting the spray after it had formed - rather than using a deflector with a different geometry - changed the spray pattern by causing it to curve inward and be much thinner. Another problem the team ran into was large streams of water dripping off the edges of the curved or flat deflectors. These streams of water, which would have to be collected to be treated and controlling the width of the spray were two challenges the team solved this semester. \n",

After wrapping the strings on the matrix model, the desired width for the spray was 4 cm, as that was the width of the wall of strings at the top of the system. Since the square tube that the team had been testing with was too thin to make a 4 cm spray, a wider tube was fabricated with a side length of 4 cm so that the resulting spray was the same width as the wall and there would be no excess water spraying at the strings. \n",

Water flows into the system through a tube connected to the water source in the lab then into the inlet cylinder. The inlet cylinder is marked with three different heights and has an orifice of diameter 0.25 in at the bottom. The first mark on the cylinder is at 3.65 cm, which is the equilibrium water height, i.e. where the water entering from the source is equal to the water flowing out the bottom of the cylinder. The second mark is at 14.6 cm, which is 4 times the height of the equilibrium height and results in a velocity that is twice the equilibrium velocity according to Toricelli’s principle. The third mark is at 32.85 cm, which is 9 times the equilibrium height and gives three times the equilibrium velocity. The orifice at the bottom of the cylinder is ¼” because this is the estimated smallest diameter that will not clog. \n",

The deflector plate is positioned a few cm away from the wall of strings and angled such that the spray that is created impinges on the center of the wall of strings, as shown in Figure 7. Then the water flows down the strings, through the matrix, and drips into a large basin on the lab bench. This setup, while still needing some modifications such as a full enclosure to further contain the spray, is promising in initial tests in terms of the creation of a spray that evenly hits the wall of strings, the reproducibility of experiments, and the ability to easily change specific parameters while keeping the rest of the variables constant. \n",

        "Following the work done in previous semesters, the Fall 2019 team focused on figureing out a way to successfully get water onto a large number of strings. The team began with two separate approaches to this challenge: spray and capillary action. Both these methods involved using the loopy yarn as in Summer 2019 and the main goals of the experiments carried out were determing the range of flow rates that could be achieved with each of the methods. Determining whether or not each of these methods could produce a target flow rate of 10 𝜇L/s per string was a main objective of this semesters' experiments, along with designing a final system from influent \"untreated\" water to \"treated\" water dripping evenly off the ends of a matrix of strings. While the semester goal of completing a finalized CAD drawing of a string digester model was not realized, a significant amount of progress was made in terms of deciding which method to move forward with and fabricating a lab-scale model that prooved promising in preliminary tests and was able to be used to determine important parameters so the team can move on to flow observation experiments next semester. \n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the capillary action experiments, the team concluded that more strings will lead to higher flow rate. However, the function between these two parameters is not just in a linear relationship. More data needs to be collected and future ploting between the flow rate and number of strings needs to further optimized in order to determine a potential equation, as well the function between the flow rate and the length of the strings. While this method did not require any small orifices or a large water pressure, the team ultimately decided to abandon the capillary action method in favor of the spray method. This decision was made because once biofilms are introduced when the team begins testing with wastewater, the capillary action mechanism and subsequent flow rates and patterns will vary greatly from what the team observed when using clean water in the lab.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The spray method, which the team chose to move forward with as the system for getting water evenly onto the strings, was more complicated than the capillary action method, but the results when biofilms are introduced will hopefully be more consistent with the clean water tests. Continuing with the string matrix design from the Summer 2019 team, this semester's team focused on minimizing the amount of wasted water that will be sprayed onto the wall of strings. This involved fabricating a square deflector tube - rather than a half- or quarter- pipe deflector or flat plate deflector - after observing that water sprayed evenly out of a square pipe. After fabricating our own square deflector and running experiments to test the effects of three different parameters, it was concluded that the best spray was created when the deflector was angled 60 degrees below the horizontal, when the flow rate was 33.23 mL/s, and the water from the influent cylinder was colliding with the deflector at a location near the front edge of the deflector (near the spray edge). While these results might need to be adjusted for the desired number of strings being tested in the lab in the future, figuring out what kind of delfector to use and how to set up the deflector plate so that the team could repeat experiments consistently was an important accomplishment of the semester.

This will include obtaining more results and data from the system to optimize the angle of the spray device, flow rate, the width of the spray device and concurrently the width of the strings on the rod on the string system itself. Based on these results, the next step would be fabricating a system that will abide by all the design parameters and also making a CAD model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once a lab model is successful in terms of water dispensing and flow down strings, future teams will also need to perform experiments with biofilms on the loopy yarn or other potential filter media to treat wastewater. Experiments with synthetic wastewater will be conducted in the lab until the team has constructed an apparatus to test at the Ithaca wastewater plant and finally implement in an AguaClara wastewater treatment plant. \n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, considering the problems after scaling up, there will be the potential to change to larger-scaled string materials to accommodate an ideal situation. The components and chemical properties of the materials need to be further examined. If degradability in materials can not be resolved, easy methods to change strings in the device need to be derived. Lastly, the patterns of the strings can be further tested as well."
