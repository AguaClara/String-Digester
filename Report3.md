## Abstract
The string digester team’s objective for this semester is to continue research on designing a new wastewater treatment system to eliminate problems associated with current trickling filters. To improve consistency in wastewater treatment, experiments will be conducted using strings to optimize surface area. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater. Initial tests involving different string materials, biofilm growth, and string spacing will help define design parameters for the construction of a functioning string digester.

## Introduction
The String Digester sub-team originated due to the remaining need for continued wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. Looking to enhance industrial-scale trickling filters, work from the previous semester identified an issue with the process: a large amount of unused space is present in almost all treatment units due to preferential flow of wastewater. The primary objective of this sub-team is to continue to discover, construct, and tweak methods that can maximize the efficiency of trickling filter wastewater treatment. The team believes that the trickling filter treatment system can significantly increase in efficacy by innovating the media aspect of the  wastewater treatment system. After conclusion of strings being a viable option for filter media, the research of this semester will focus on augmenting the amount of used volume within the trickling filter by examining different materials of strings as well as the placement of this form of media on a filter. With this work, the team will work towards assessing the feasibility of the implementation of a modified trickling filter unit in future AguaClara treatment plant while striving to make significant technological improvements on industry-standard applications for the system.

Research dealing with trickling filter wastewater treatment was ubiquitous in the 1970's and 1980's, however, research on this method of treatment significantly decreased in following decades. Research on wastewater treatment shifted more towards processes higher in energy consumption. That being said, a notable feature of the trickling filter wastewater treatment are the low-energy requirements to run the system. The beneficial feature is the driving force to the development of the String Digester sub-team for AguaClara. With modification, the trickling filter treatment system carries much potential to be implemented in areas of the world in which capital expenditure is a major barrier for employing this technology.

Last semester, the Trickling Filter team spent a substantial amount of time doing research and gathering information on the operational difficulties, the kinetics, and typical design parameters of trickling filters. The team aimed to address many of the issues plant operators encounter with trickling filters, like clogging and ponding, lack of moisture in parts of the filter, and generally inefficiency of the filter. The two main areas for improvement the team identified were the filter media itself and the distribution system.

The team fabricated a bench top model for flow mapping and conducted several rounds of tests to determine the distribution of flow in trickling filters with small rock and marble media. From these experiments, the team noticed that there were significant portions of the media that never got wet and thus concluded that a substantial volume of the trickling filter was unused due to preferential flow and therefore there is wasted space. From these tests the team also showed that a uniform packing material is superior to a random material. In an effort to both maximize the surface area to volume ratio and to minimize the footprint of the system by not wasting space, the team shifted focus towards strings as a possible filter media. This concept led the team to start with very preliminary testing of a system that was essentially an overflowing basin with strings submerged at the top, inside the basin, and draped over the sides to guide water down to a collection bucket below. In these initial tests, the team members observed that the water overflowing does in fact follow the along strings when it overflows. From these observations, the String Digester team will now begin more rigorous testing on the concept and investigate whether using strings in a wastewater treatment system is truly viable.

## Literature Review
### Trickling Filters
The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and thus preferential flow occurs. Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused. This leads to a less efficient treatment of organic matter than if all of the space in the filter were utilized. One suggestion from the author is specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation & allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018).](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215)

In addition to non-homogenous distribution of wastewater throughout the filter, there is significant documentation of other problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. One major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not addressed, the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims avoid the problem altogether by using strings and not having a media that can clog up. It is still an important factor to consider in the design because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system will likely clog up with biofilm growth.

Ali and co-authors state that the aforementioned sloughing and clogging is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Uneven HLR is caused by clogging of the distribution arm and an uneven distribution of influent. Therefore, proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of influent distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors consist of moving parts that require more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. Additionally, this system will not serve the string-focused design.

The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system, utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the medium and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a string media. However, both the fixed and rotating distribution systems have an inconsistent hydraulic load of the influent [(Sperling 2007)](https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402123.pdf). Therefore, the distribution system is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.


Although there are multiple problems with trickling filters, one main advantage of trickling filters is that they have a relatively low residence time. This is a consideration which the team should plan to maintain in future designs. Hinton and Stensel measured residence time per unit length of between 30 and 40 sec/m with dye tests. Their predicted residence times, calculated from laminar flow theory, were closer to about 15 sec/m. The authors attributed this discretion to "dye sorption and desorption by the biofilm." In either case, the residence time for a 5 meter deep trickling filter would be well under 5 minutes [(Hinton and Stensel 1991)](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135491901179/1-s2.0-0043135491901179-main.pdf?_tid=e8d2db22-8e0f-4d3c-a421-352ef74e6f5e&acdnat=1540500088_4808114af12660c061fbd139ac0fbd33). This short treatment time makes trickling filters an appealing wastewater treatment option if problems such as uneven HLR and clogging can be minimized.

### Trickling Filter Alternatives
Downward Hanging Sponge (DHS) Reactors are another form of treating wastewater. They have a similar mechanism as trickling filters. Water is distributed onto sponges and water trickles down through and on the sponges due to gravity. Biofilm grows within and on the sponge and removes organic nutrients from the wastewater as it trickles down. Onodera and co-authors found the advantages of DHS include: high biomass concentration, high sludge residence time, low hydraulic retention time, small footprint. There are six generations of the DHS reactor. The different generations are different sizes and geometries of sponges including sponge cubes, curtain long triangular sponge strips on a plastic sheet, sponge packing unit in net-like plastic, and the most recent generation: a rigid sponge from a mix of polyurethane and epoxy resin. Polyurethane was shown to support microorganism growth and retain water [(Onodera 2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24291312). In addition, the high porosity of the sponge enhances diffusion of air into the wastewater, and maintains an dissolved oxygen at level higher than necessary for aerobes. This way, no extra aeration is necessary for the system compared to traditional aerobic treatment systems [(M. Tandukar et al., 2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16180445).

DHS reactors are an appealing alternative to traditional trickling filters as they overcome some problems. One problem DHS overcomes is a low sludge residence time. This is because micro-organisms can grow both inside and on the surface of the sponge. This also optimizes the space. The DHS was also shown to have lower excess sludge than the traditional trickling filter. Onodera and co-authors showed that DHS reactors are a viable secondary treatment post USAB and that sponges have much potential in treating wastewater [(Onodera 2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24291312).

### Biofilm
A component of the string digester that is crucial to its success is the biofilm. "A biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells that is irreversibly associated (not removed by gentle rinsing) with a surface and enclosed in a matrix of primarily polysaccharide material." [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) Biofilm attachment is a complex process regulated by diverse characteristics of the growth medium, substratum, and cell surface. Biofilm on trickling filters are composed of a variety of organisms and are typically enclosed in a polysaccharide. The biofilm matrix may also contain mineral crystals, corrosion particles, and clay or silt particles. Biofilms in wastewater systems are often highly complex [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)

Some testing has been done of the growth of biofilm in different surfaces. One study compared growth on glossy electro-polished, bright annealed stainless steel to matte stainless steel and to PVC. The paper notes that stainless steel is hydrophilic and PVC is hydrophobic. In the last 45 days of the 167 day experiment, the matte steel had about 1.44 times more microorganisms than the electro-polished steel, and there was no significant difference between the PVC and polished steel. In discussion of why this occurs, Pedersen cites two reasons: "detachment due to shear forces from the flow will be reduced on the rougher surface since cells can be shielded from the bulk flow and more substratum surface area may be available for the biofilm" [(Pedersen 1990).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)


## Methods

### Initial Experiment

#### Objective of Experiment
The objective of the initial experiment was to determine the amount of water that could be held on different types of string and make connections between specific properties of the strings, like surface area or texture, and how much water they can hold at one time.

#### Experimental Apparatus
A scale was secured approximately one meter above a lab bench resting on supports at each corner so the bottom of the scale was left open. There is a hook on the bottom of the scale that measures the weight that is hung from the hook. A single string was attached to the hook on the bottom of the scale and allowed to hang down freely, see Figure 1 below.

#### Strings
Because the focus of the experiment was on the properties of string, the team tested several types. The team chose four strings varying in non-biodegradable material, structure, and diameter. For polymer-based materials: a polypropylene, twine string with a diameter of 0.0500 inches and a nylon, monofilament string with a diameter of 0.0220 inches were tested. For metal alloy material: a 304-type stainless steel wire with a diameter of 0.0200 inches and a 304-type stainless steel cable with a diameter of 0.0625 inches were tested. The stainless steel cable was lubricated upon purchase.

For the remainder of the report, the following strings will be referred to by the following names: polypropylene twine will be referred to as "twine", the nylon monofilament string will be referred to as "nylon string", the stainless steel wire will be referred to as "wire", and the stainless steel cable will be referred to as "cable".

The strings were selected based on their ability to withstand a wastewater treatment system. The scope of the potential materials for strings was immediately narrowed to non-biodegradable materials due to the team's realization that biodegradable strings would not be durable in a system that continuously covered them in wastewater and would not be able to support the necessary biofilm without degrading. Metal alloys and polymer-based materials were the most accessible materials to obtain, so it was decided to obtain equal amount of strings in each. The structure and diameter of the strings was differentiated in each material group due to the notion that surface texture and/or diameter of the strings could have an effect on water flow and the team's desire to test this effect.

#### Procedure
A narrow tube was connected to a peristaltic pump and water was pumped at a known rate. The end of the tube was directed onto the top of the string hanging from the scale, in an attempt to allow water to flow onto and down the hanging string. The scale was zeroed before the experiment started so the scale would just measure the weight of the water on the string. The idea was to get water flowing on the string and then, while continuously pumping water onto the string, measure the weight of the water on the string at a moment in time. From this measurement, the team would be able to quantify how much water a particular string could hold per unit length.

#### Results and Analysis
The method of directing the water onto the string did not work. The team tried several angles and techniques to try to get the water from the tube to connect and travel down the string but were unsuccessful. Water spiraled off the string upon immediate contact and was not able to trickle down the hanging string. Therefore, taking weight measurements was not possible or useful, as the expected sheath of water on the string did not form. This experiment was tested with twine and wire, and then abandoned due to lack of success.

The failure of this test prompted the team to question whether the water would flow on the strings at all, as the team in the previous semester (spring 2018) had been able to observe with yarn/cotton based string. Because of this question of whether the new types of strings would work at all, the team decided to return to the experiment conducted by the Spring 2018 team and see if the current team could recreate the success of the previous semester, where they had seen the string prototype perform well and the strings hold water as expected.

### Recreated Experiment

#### Objective of Experiment

The objective of this experiment was to see if the water would run down the new strings using the basin distribution system from Spring 2018 or if all the new strings were unable to hold any water at all.

#### Experimental Apparatus
The experiment from last semester was recreated using the strings as media, rather than the cotton yarn. A basin was filled with water and attached at an elevated surface about one meter above the lab bench. Strings were then wrapped tightly around the top of the basin and at a metal rod below the basin. The strings were set up so they were evenly spaced and perpendicular to the ground. The amount of a string wrapped on the apparatus as well as the different types of strings wrapped on the apparatus was up to the discretion of the sub-team.

#### Strings
The strings from the initial experiment were used again in this experiment. Reference to the "String" subsection of the Initial Experiment for more information on the strings.

#### Procedure
String was wrapped around the dispenser and around a bottom pole in one long strand and pulled taught. The basin was filled with water using the peristaltic pump to induce overflow. As the water overflows the basin, the water will find a path down. All four of the aforementioned materials were tested in this fashion at varying pumping rates.

#### Results and Analysis

The water did not "like" any of the materials. It mostly avoided the strings and flowed over the side of the basin at the top, falling freely through the air instead of attaching to a string. In addition, the water that did get onto the materials formed droplets and didn't travel down string in a constant flow (see Figure 4). The minimal water that did attach to the strings initially would then spiral off part way down. The cable was hard to experiment on as it didn't conform to the sharp edges of the basin and did not make good contact with the water.

From these results, the team confirmed the concern that these strings were not inclined to carry water the way the cotton yarn had in Spring 2018. These experiments suggested to the team that the material of the strings might be hydrophilic, or at least water adverse in the sense that they were unwilling to carry water. The team was not yet ready to abandon the idea of using the purchased strings altogether, so an effort was made to modify the system to get the water to go on the strings (and stay on) more often.


### Modified Experiments
#### Objective of Experiment
The team objective of the next set of experiments was to see if the team could use a modified design of the system to "encourage" the water to attach to and better follow along the string. The team wanted to observe whether a gradual slope would help the water flow down onto the strings rather then straight down off the sides of the basin.

#### Experimental Apparatus
Because the water was avoid the strings, the team modified the experimental apparatus to give the water more time and a gentler slope to flow onto the string. Using the set up described in the recreated experiment (Reference to the “Experimental Apparatus” subsection of the Recreated Experiment for more information), the team modified the basin by attaching two plastic arcs, or "wings". This was done by cutting pieces of PVC pipe into quarters to create quarter circles and glueing the arcs onto the sides of the basin so that the basin had downward sloping sides (see Figures 5 and 6). To ensure the basin was watertight, glue was applied to all the seams. To keep the strings vertical when wrapped around the setup, a flat rectangle of acrylic was taped to the bar at bottom of the setup.

#### Strings
The strings from the initial experiment were used again in this experiment. Reference to the “String” subsection of the Initial Experiment for more information on the strings.

Since the cable was lubricated, the team washed it with soap and water before testing in hopes that this would make it less hydrophobic. The twine was also untwisted and tested as a secondary modification to the experiment.

#### Procedure
This experiment was run in the same way as previous experiment. A pump was used to regulate the flow of water into the basin. The team experimented with different flow rates and observed how water flowed or did not flow down the various strings. Reference to the “Procedure” subsection of the Recreated Experiment for more information.

#### Results and Analysis
Despite introducing a gradual slope for the water to flow down, the results of this experiment were similar to the results from the recreated experiment. The strings were still hydrophobic so the water avoided flowing down the strings even when on the curved plastic. If the water did flow along the string on the plastic, droplets began to fall off the strings once they left the plastic at the top. The water overflowing from the basin was irregular and often flowed over the curved plastic in paths between the strings.

The lack of consistent or particularly promising results prompted the team to look at new materials. Moving forward, the team decided to test numerous chains and foam/sponge material strings to see if different materials would be better suited to use in the string digester.


### New Materials Experiments

#### Objective of Experiment

The team objective on this set of experiments was to further experiment with metal-alloy based chains, and to determine if foams could be feasible as a string medium. The team wanted to try lots of materials to see if there were any successes, and so preformed many experiments.

#### Experimental Apparatus

To get a broad sense of the feasibility of the new materials as string media, this experiment featured each string being put through three different tests that varied by physical features of the experimental apparatuses. Using a new set of strings, the first test was using the experimental setup described in the recreated experiment. The second test was using the experimental setup described in the modified experiment with the winged basin (mentioned above). The third test was newly created, and involved using a basin that was half the size of the original basin used in the recreated experiment; in this case, the basin was 1.5 inches in length. This was done by fabricating a new basin based on the desired length. This three tests were conducted in order to observe water flow on the string media with and without physical manipulations. The tests were conducted in a similar way that the recreated and modified experiments (mentioned above) were conducted in. A pump was used to regulate the flow of water into the basin. The team experimented with different flow rates and observed how water flowed or did not flow down the various strings.


#### Strings

For the string aspect of the new materials experiments, eight new materials were purchased to use as the string media. For metal alloy-based materials, four unfinished stainless steel chains that varied in chain type were purchased: a 50-foot, size-12, sash chain, a 10-foot, size-35, sash chain, a 50-foot, size-18, jack chain, and a 50-foot, size-3, bead chain were purchased. For the polymer-based materials, four polymer foams were purchased: a 20-foot, closed-cell construction, chemical-resistant, grey polyethylene cord with a diameter of 0.500 inches, a 36 by 2 inch, open-cell construction, ultra-conformable, teal polyurethane strip with a thickness of 0.500 inches, a 36 by 2 inch, open-cell construction, super-cushioning, white polyurethane sheet with a thickness of 0.5000 inches, and a 24 by 24 inch, open-cell construction, super-absorbent, blue polyurethane sheet with a thickness of 0.2500 inches.

For the remainder of the report, the metal-alloy based strings will be referred to by the following: the size-35 sash chain will be referred to as "big sash chain", the size-12 sash chain will be referred to as "small sash chain", the size-18 jack chain will be referred to as "jack chain", and the size-3 bead chain cable will be referred to as "bead chain". The polymer-based foams will be referred to by the following: the grey polyethylene cord will be referred to as "grey foam", the teal polyurethane foam will be referred to as "teal foam", the white polyurethane foam will be referred to as "white foam", and the blue polyurethane foam will be referred to as "blue foam".

Following the results of the previous experiments, the scope of what materials of string to use in this set of experiments was immediately narrowed to hydrophilic, non-biodegradable strings. The polymer-based strings were scrapped as they exhibited no hydrophilic property in the set of experiments, so it was decided to switch over from monofilaments, to a material more porous. Thus, the team decided to look into polymer-based foams, as they would most likely exhibit hydrophilic properties and retain the non-biodegradability. Furthermore, the metal-alloy based strings appeared as if they could work in previous experiments but were inhibited by the lubricant left on the chains after manufacturing. Thus, the team decided to purchase chains that were unfinished to ensure there was no finish left on the chain. Finally, the structure and diameter of the strings was differentiated in each material group due to the notion that surface texture and/or diameter of the strings could have a strong effect on water flow.

#### Procedure
The desired strings were wrapped around the dispenser and around a bottom pole in one long strand (amount of strings is at discretion of sub-team) and pulled taught for each test in the experiment. The basin was filled with water using the peristaltic pump to induce overflow. As the water overflows the basin, the water will find a path down. All eight of the aforementioned materials were tested in this similar fashion for each test differentiating in basin type at varying pumping rates.

#### Results and Analysis

In the following table, size 16 tubing was used to dispense water into the basins and strands were spaced 5-10 mm apart.

|Material|Pump Speed [rpm]|1.5in Basin|3.75in Basin|4.5in Winged Basin|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Jack Chain|25, 50 80, 100|5 strands on each side of basin<br>25 & 50 rpm: flow down 5/10 chains, flowed down strands closest to wall (basin may not have been level)<br>80 rpm: flow down 5/10 chains<br>100 rpm: flow down 7/10 chains, two chains stuck together|10 strands on each side of basin<br>At each speed only 2-4 chains on each side of the basin had consistent water flow<br>Water bridged gaps in chain|10 strands on each side of basin<br>Narrow Base<br>25 rpm: water flowed down one side of basin (basin may not have been level)<br>50 rpm: flow down 10/10 of strands on one side, only 1/10 on the other side<br>80 rpm: flow down 7-9/10 on one side but 0-2/10 on the other side<br>Widened Base<br>25 & 50 rpm: flow down 4/20 strands<br>80 rpm: flow down 5/20 strands|   
|Bead Chain|25, 50, 80|Not tested |25 & 50 rpm: 90% of strings hold water and have consistent flow<br>80 rpm: too fast, water starts to jump of strings|Narrow Base: Didn't work well, less strings got wet compared to the wide base or the other setups<br>Wide Base: 50% of strings had flow, didn't work as well as predicted|
|Small Sash Chain|25, 50, 80|5 strands on each side<br>25 rpm: few strings with flow<br>50 rpm: 50% of chains carrying water, can manipulate with hands to get flow down 90% of strands<br>80 rpm: too fast for this few strings, water drips over edge of basin without adhering to chain|Similar results at each speed, only difference was flowrate down the chains<br>Flow down 20% of strands<br>Once wetted more chains carried water|Little to no flow down strands<br>Water flows to end of wings then drips off|
|Big Sash Chain|25, 50|2 strands on each side of basin<br>25 rpm: chain is too thick for our setup so water spills over basin sides<br>Flow down strands if water is dispensed directly onto chain<br>50 rpm: water spills over sides of basin|Not tested: Chain is not long enough to have a different setup|Works slightly better than straight sided basin<br>Would need a different distribution method to direct water directly onto the chain|

Based on these initial tests, the bead chain on the the 3.75in basin and the jack chain on the 4.5in winged basin had the most promising results. At multiple speeds, these two setups resulted in the highest number of strands with consistent flow and the team was able to observe water  filling the gaps in the chains; the water filled the holes in the jack chain and filled the gaps between the beads on the bead chain. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using chains as strands in a string digester. Further tests with these chains, possibly varying in thickness, length, and pump speed would be helpful in determining an optimal setup to treat water.

|Foam|Results|
|---|---|
|Teal Foam|Using the 3.750 inch basin, the foam was cut into 0.7500-inch square cross sections, duct-taped two pieces together at the top, and had tape in middle of basin. Two foam strings were wrapped around (2 strings on each side), water was convex in the dispenser and water flowed over side and on top of sponge. The foam strings worked slightly better when they were pre-wet, but still, a large amount of water was flowing on the outside.|
|Blue Foam|Using the 1.500 inch basin, the foam was cut into 0.2500-inch square cross sections, and were let hang loosely down. Four foam strings were on each side, with strings touching. There was no water tension in basin, and water was concave; water ran down and saturated all the foam strings. There was no need to pre-wet, as most of the water was running through the foam and not on the sides. The team was able to see that the water was flowing through the center of the foam as well as running down the outside. The foam strings were tested at several different speeds, and exhibited the same results at each speed.|
|White Foam|Using the 3.750 inch basin, the foam was cut into 0.7500-inch square cross sections, taped at top and had two strands on each side similar to the set-up for the teal strings. The water droplets were absorbed to foam strings: water was concave in the dispenser, and water flowed on outside and down in all of the strings. There was no need to pre-wet, but it was difficult to tell if water was only flowing down the outside of the strands or if it was also flowing through the center. Strands were very heavy after testing, which indicated that a lot of water had been absorbed in the center of the strand.|
|Grey Foam|Using the 3.750 inch basin, the initial tests (without modifying the foam) did not work, as water was not absorbed by foam and did not like flowing down the strands. The cords were then cut in half (inside of strand seemed more absorbent), and were wrapped around, tried with both flat side (inside) and rounded side towards the dispenser. Water formed droplets on material, but did not absorb much. Pre-wetting did not help, and water flowed over edge of dispenser and not onto the gray sponge.|

For the polymer-based foams, the foams were not tested on each of the apparatuses in this experiment due to the lack of needed length. Aside from the grey foam, each of the foams had to be physically altered into a string, and upon doing so, it left the team with little length to work with. Thus, the foams were used on the testing apparatus that allowed for a feasible amount of wrapping with good spacing in between so that valid data could be collected.

Based on the data collected, it is clear that the blue foam worked best out of the foams purchased. The blue foam required no manipulation such as pre-wetting, and were able to retain a large amount of water. The teal and white foam also worked well, but needed some sort of manipulation to better the water flow. Furthermore, the grey foam did not work at all, as no water was able to flow down the strings. The grey foam is also the only closed-cell constructed foam, thus making the foam moisture resistant. Knowing this beforehand, the results of the grey foam were somewhat expected.

Looking at the data for foams, it shows that foams could be a feasible media for the string. Besides the grey foam, the foams seemed to retain water easily, and there was little to no water flowing on the outside of the foams. The blue foam seemed to be the most promising, as it was easy to work with after physical altercation into strings. The foam was exhibiting similar results at various pumping speeds, thus minimizing the weight of how pumping speed can affect water flow on the strings.

Furthermore, the open-cell construction foams exhibited better results than the closed-cell construction foam. The closed-cell construction foam built water tension on the basin, and was not able to carry the water as wanted. Based on the data collected, the idea of using closed-cell construction foams as string media could be ruled out, and research on open-cell construction foams should be furthered.


## Conclusions
The team at first experienced difficulties finding a material for the strings that is both non-biodegradable and will allow the wastewater to stay on the string as it falls over the side of the basin instead of coming off and just falling freely. Experimentation showed that the plastic polymer based string options will not work as a filter media unless somehow altered to make them hydrophilic. The stainless steel based strings show more potential but still seem to require some modifications to the design before they will work with any consistency. The foams and chains show promise as potential materials for a string digester. These materials were able to retain water as it trickled down. The blue foam worked exceptionally well as it absorbed water. The initial testing done on these materials suggests they could work in the proposed system and make the string digester technology possible.

Creating a rapid but efficient string digester would be impactful for the future of AguaClara's involvement in wastewater treatment. String digesters have the potential to greatly decrease the wastewater processing time and also decrease the organic solutes in the effluent. By maximizing potential surface area for the microbes to grow on using strings and sponges, thereby allowing for more microbial digestion of the water, some traditional trickling filter problems would be solved or minimized. Effluent from the UASB will require further treatment and the team believes that a string digester could provide the necessary treatment with minimal energy requirements.

## Future Work

In the next week, the team will work to identify which of the new materials are the most promising for the project's success. In terms of how exactly the team will do this, more thought and brainstorming is needed as there are many factors that contribute to what makes a material better than others for the filter.

Moving forward, the team should do more rigorous testing of the better materials and try to identify properties that best serve the proposed system. Following identification of the most feasible material, next semester should focus more on research in the biofilm and wastewater areas using the specific material. Specifically, will the selected materials support microbial growth to a degree that the desired level of treatment may be reached? Do the strings allow for growth of all the required types of biofilm, do anaerobic and aerobic zones exist? These are all questions that should be answered in future research. Another aspect of the project that should be further developed and explored is the dispensing system, which the team has not really attempted to optimize or improve as of yet.

The team sees a future for the string digester sub-team, in that there is potential in the current design, but much more research and development is necessary.
