# Deflector Plate Geometry

**Goal:** To find the deflector plate geometry that produces the best spray at the lowest flow rates possible. A good spray is flat and very wide.

**Previous Work:**
Previous geometries used included a flat strip of plastic, a 1/4 PVC pipe, a round bottle bottom with slits cut in to form a sprinkler head, and a plastic spoon with the tip cut off.

So far the 1/2 spoon worked the best at controlling the shape of the spray. Very little water was wasted from the spoon and it was much less splashy than the 1/4 PVC pipe. However, the width of the spray was limited by the width of the spoon. A wider spray was needed to accommodate a longer line of strings

## Experiment 1.1

**Hypothesis:** A wider spray can be achieved by using a larger spoon

**Procedure:** The subteam obtained large spoon and cut off the end at it's widest part, which was 6.5 cm. Water was sprayed on it from both the sink and the water column.

**Results:**
The water spray from the sink filled the entire spoon and reached the maximum desired width of about 6.5 cm. However, this only occurred at high flow rates. As the strength of the faucet decreased, the water spray became much more narrow and did not fill up the entirety of the spoon. Tilting the spoon at a more downward angle improved the quality of the spray somewhat, but not enough to achieve the correct spray width. Additionally, moving the spoon up and down (closer to and away from the orifice) did not change the quality of the spray very much.

The subteam struggled to obtain the same results from the sink with the water column. RPM's between 260 and 370 were used, but none achieved a full 6.5 cm spray width.

**Conclusion:** The width of the spray is predominantly controlled by the flow rate of water.
