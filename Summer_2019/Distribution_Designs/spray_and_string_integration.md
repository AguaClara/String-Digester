We have created a structure to hold the current experimental apparatus shown in the picture below.

**Orifice-Deflector Distance:** ~ 30 cm

# Problems with the Water Spray
## Problem 1
Water splashes everywhere and off the back of the deflector plate
**Potential Solutions**
- keep adjusting the angle and position of the deflector plate to get the water to hit perfectly on the tangent to the deflector plate.
- Increase the flow rate from the peristaltic pump: At 288 RPM there are approximately 3 cm of water in the column. But we observed in jet_flow_rate Experiment 3.3 our minimum 'good' spray was at a height of 4 cm. It is possible that this number needs to be even higher than 4 cm to get a clean enough spray.
- alter the orifice-deflector distance: We saw in jet_flow_rate Experiment 3.3 that larger distances made the spray more splashy, but also allowed for 'acceptable' sprays at lower flow rates. Can the distance be decreased any more without compromising the integrity of the spray pattern.


## Problem 2
- The flow from the orifice does not stay in one position. It wiggles back and forth, making it difficult to position the deflector plate
**Potential Solutions:**
- the problem seemed to improve as the flow rate increased


# Problems with the string matrix
- the two main rods are positioned awkwardly together. It would be easier to wrap if the rod on the right was raised slightly above the other.
- the strings on the main rod overlap a lot. Is this a bad thing?
