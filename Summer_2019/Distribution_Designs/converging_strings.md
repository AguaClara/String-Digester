# Design #1: Converging Strings

**Basic Premise:** Spray or pour water over a group of strings that are all touching at a single point or along a single line. Water will ideally distribute itself evenly among all strings and follow each string towards a collection basin. Align the strings at an angle such that they get farther apart from each other as water trickles downwards. Ideally the strings would reach a final separation of 5 mm at the base where they would be anchored in place.

## Experiment 1
**June 4, 2019**

**Goal:** Determine if water will distribute itself over several lines of string brought together, and if it will subsequently trickle down the strings without falling off.

Consider whether the angle between two adjacent strings influences the ability of water to remain on the string.  

### Experimental Apparatus
**Insert pictures here**

**Materials:**
- 7 pieces of **Dacron** string
- ... 

**Dimensions:**
- Height of support: 18 cm
- Perpendicular distance from support to strings at the farthest anchor point: 12.5 cm (this is only true for Trial 1, this distance may have varied for Trials 2 and 3)

### Methods & Results

#### Trial 1

**Setup:**
- strings anchored to every other chain link
- Base of "String triangle": 5.5 cm
- height of "string triangle": 18.0 cm from center of base to top of triangle

**Observations:**
- some of the water traveled down the strings (mostly the middle string) while some fell off near the base of the support.
- water often flowed between 2 strings, the surface tension from the water often pulled two strings close together such that they were touching.
- applying tension did not improve flow much. Droplets clearly fell off before reaching the bottom of the string.

**Conclusions:**
- need a wider angle between strings
- also try to increase the tension of the strings

#### Trial 2

**Setup:**
- 2 spaces in chainlink between each strings
- Angle between adjacent springs: 5 degrees
- Base of "String triangle": 8.5 cm
- height of "string triangle": 24.0 cm from center of base to top of triangle
-
**Observations:**
- water still flows between strings, but there is less string-string interaction.
- larger water droplets caused the strings to interact

**Conclusions:**
- try using the peristaltic pump to create smaller and more consistent water
- try using a small piece of foam to apply water more evenly across all strings

#### Trial 3

**Setup:**
- 3 spaces in chainlink between each strings
- Angle between adjacent springs: 10 degrees
- used the peristaltic pump at 100 RPM and the microtubing to apply water to strings
- only used the three middle strings in this trial for simplicity

**Observations:**
- adjacent strings did not get pulled together by the water at this angle, but when water flowed between them, it stills fell off as soon as the distance between the strings got too wide
- making the strings more vertical improved flow downwards but the water was still falling off.

### Experiment Conclusions:
The idea of converging strings remains a challenge. There are two main problems with this design: first, is finding a realistic way to get the water on the strings in a way that distributes it evenly. The second problem is keeping that water on the string as the distance between adjacent strings increases. With all of the strings converging at the water source, it is inevitable that some of the water flows between the strings rather than on individual strings. At some point, however, the water must 'pick a string' when the distance between two adjacent strings becomes too wide. Our experiment shows, however, that instead of 'picking a string' the water simply fell off the strings altogether. This occurred at every angle that was tested.

The issue of keeping water on the string could potentially be resolved by using a material that is more hydrophilic or has an increased ability to hold water. In the future, this experiment could be repeated using an acrylic loopy yarn rather than the Dacron string. Additionally a simpler experimental apparatus could be used for this test, by using only two strings and tying them together at the top.
