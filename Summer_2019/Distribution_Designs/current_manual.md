# Manual
This manual is broken down into several different experimental methods, each with a brief description, list of materials, fabrication details, special components, and experimental procedure.

## Maximum String Angle Experiment
Determine the minimum angle that a string (specifically loopy yarn) can be displaced from the vertical position such that no water falls off of the string prematurely as it runs down.

### Materials
- Loopy yarn
- Peristaltic pump with microtubing of ID = 0.5mm

### Fabrication Details
1. Cut a length (at least 20cm) of yarn and attach one end of yarn to object where the yarn can hang down and the angle between the length of yarn and the vertical can be varied from 0 to 90 degrees.

2. Set up peristaltic pump to drip water onto the top of the string and pump at 75.0 rpm

### Special Components
- Loopy yarn: Mill Ends 1 lb Acrylic Blend

### Experimental Procedure
1. Gradually pull the bottom end of the string outwards, increasing the angle between the string and the vertical from 0 to just below 90 degrees.

2. Observe the path the water travels as this angle is increased.

## Converging Strings Experiment
Determine if water will distribute itself over several lines of string brought together, and if it will subsequently trickle down the strings without falling off. Consider whether the angle between two adjacent strings influences the ability of water to remain on the string.  

### Materials
- Loopy yarn
- Tape

### Fabrication Details
1. Cut two 20cm lengths of loopy yarn and use tape to secure one end of each string to a single point 10cm above a table.

2. Secure the other end of each string to points on the table so that the taught strings form a diagonal and are spaced 5mm apart.

### Special Components
- None

### Experimental Procedure
1. Use a pipette to drip water onto the point where the strings converge and observe the flow of water down the strings.

2. Vary the angle between the strings by increasing or decreasing the distance between the strings on the table and observe the flow of water.

## Basin With Holes Experiment
Experiment with small holes, and distribution of water from a basin down several strings.

### Materials
- Loopy yarn
- Plastic sheet 14 x 23cm
- 2 plastic rectangles 5.3 x 5.8cm (sides of basin)
- 2 plastic rectangles 8.9 x 3.6cm (sides of basin)
- 1 plastic rectangle 8.9 x 3.7cm (bottom of basin)
- PCV glue
- Electrical drill with **drill bit size for holes** drill bit
- 13 cuvettes
- 13 hex nuts

### Fabrication Details
#### Fabrication of Basin
1. Use PCV glue and the small plastic rectangles to form a basin.

2. Mark a grid of points 2.5cm by 2.5cm on the bottom of the basin with points every 5mm in each direction.

3. Drill through selected points (red points in image below) using specified drill bit size.

  </p>

#### Experiment Set-up
1. Cut 13 20cm lengths of loopy yarn and thread one end of each string through a hole in the bottom of the basin, knotting twice to secure on inside of basin.

2. Tie a hex nut at the other end of each string as a weight to keep the strings taught.

3. Secure basin at a height so the strings  hang down.

4. Glue cuvettes to the 14 x 23cm piece of plastic in the same pattern as the drilled holes so that each hex nut can be placed in a cuvette and the corresponding string will form a straight line from the basin to the cuvette.

5. Mark each cuvette 1-13 for reference.

### Special Components
- Basin **image**

### Experimental Procedure
1. Ensure that the knots in the basin are directly over the drilled holes and that the strings are taught.

2. Fill the basin with water and observe how long it takes to empty, the flow of water down each string, and the distribution of water collected in the cuvettes.

3. Record data such as volume of water added to basin, time for basin to empty, and the height of water in each cuvette in a table. Calculate total flowrate and flowrate per string and record.   

4. Take hexnuts and strings out of cuvettes to empty cuvettes then place the back to repeat experiment.


## Deflector Plate Experiments
Determine a material and geometry that will produce an ideal spray pattern (a line of spray).

### Materials
- Flat piece of plastic 1" x 19.5"
- 1/2 plastic pipe (5cm inner diameter)
- 1/4 plastic pipe (5cm inner diameter)
- Plastic bottle
- Bandsaw
- Sink

### Fabrication Details
#### Sprinkler deflector plate fabrication
1. Using bandsaw, cut off the bottom centimeter of the bottle.

2. Mark 20 1cm lines uniformly spaced around the edge of the circle from the bottom of the bottle.

3. Use the band saw to cut 1cm slits around the bottom of the bottle.

### Special Components
- Sprinkler deflector plate (modeled from FSPS deflector, see Literature Review: Water Distribution)

### Experimental Procedure
1. In a sink, begin with a uniform flowrate and, one at a time, place each deflector in the flow to create a spray pattern.

2. Observe spray pattern (droplet size, spray distance, ...) and any changes when the position (height or orientation) of the deflector is changed.


## Spray Experiments
Determine the flow rate, orifice size, and water height that will produce the best jet spray. Ideally the jet spray would cover a wide surface area evenly with small water droplets.

### Materials
- Clear PVC tube with inner diameter 4.5cm and length at least 60cm
- Plastic sheet (8 x 6.5cm)
- PVC glue
- Tape measure
- Deflector plate (from above experiment)
- Sink
- Electric drill
- Drill bits: 7/32", 3/8", 15/64", 17/64"
- 6L bucket
- Tape
- Tape measures

### Fabrication Details
#### Fabrication of water dispensing tube
1. Use PVC glue to attach PVC sheet to one end of the PVC tube with a watertight seal.

2. Mark and label heights every 5cm from the bottom of the tube (with the PVC sheet) to the top.

3. Drill one hole of each size in the bottom of the PVC sheet so that each is inside the circumference of the tube but not too close to each other.

### Special Components

### Experimental Procedure
Three different procedures were tested to observe how changing different parameters effects spray patterns:

*For each experiment, extend a tape measure across the sink to observe the extent of the spray*

#### 1. Varying Water Height
1. Tape over all but one hole on the bottom of the water column.

2. Plug remaining hole with a finger and fill column with water to a height of at least 50cm.

3. Hold column at a constant height above the deflector plate in the sink, unplug the hole, and direct water onto deflector plate to create a spray.

4. Record/video what the spray looked like at several different water heights.

#### 2. Varying Orifice Diameter
1. Repeat the above Varying Water Height experiment with the varying drilled hole diameters

#### 3. Varying Distance Between Orifice and Deflector
1. Repeat the above Varying Water Height experiments but change the height the column is held above the deflector plate for each test (begin with a distance of 10cm and increase to 50cm in 10cm increments).

## Current Model
Model to test string separation distance, converging strings, and experiment with applying water to a line of strings with a spray.

### Materials
- Loopy yarn
- Plastic beads
- Plywood 30 x 45cm
- Drill
- Drill bits: 1.4mm, 1/4"
- 3 15cm 1/4"- 20 threaded rods
- 6 1/4"- 20 hex nuts
- 3 10cm lengths of 1/4" inner diameter tubing
- 20 metal rods with outer diameter 0.00625"
- Glue

### Fabrication Details
1. Orient the plywood rectangle so the shorter side is at the bottom. Drill a horizontal row of 10 1.4mm holes spaced 5mm apart 10cm from the bottom of the plywood.

2. Drill a second row of 10 1.4mmholes spaced 5mm apart 10cm above the first row.

3. Drill one 1/4" hole 2cm below the center of the first row of 1.4mm holes and one 1/4" hole 8cm above the second row of 1.4mm holes.

4. Drill one 1/4" hole 2cm to the right and 1cm above the topmost 1/4" hole.

5. Insert the 15cm 1/4"- 20 threaded rods into the 1/4" holes and secure each with hex nuts. Place lengths of tubing over the threaded rods for a smooth surface to wrap strings around.

6. Insert the rods into the smaller holes, ensuring they are secure.

7. Place 8 beads on each rod and secure in place by gluing the top bead on each rod.

8. Secure the end of the yarn with tape and wrap around the rods to create a string matrix of 88 strings that converges at the top and bottom 1/4" rods. Wrap the yarn so that it goes between each bead, does not overlap, and is very taught.

### Special Components
