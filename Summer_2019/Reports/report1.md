## Introduction

### Water Distribution
Uniform water distribution is essential for many applications such as irrigation and water treatment. One common method for distributing water over a relatively large are is using a spray. There are several different methods for creating a spray, two being the Fixed Spray Plate Sprinklers (FSPS) and Rotating Spray Plate Sprinklers (RSPS). In a comparative study conducted by Faci et al. (2001) ([Comparison of Fixed and Rotating Spray Plate Sprinklers](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9437%282001%29127%3A4%28224%29)). In analyzing the two types of sprinklers for irrigation purposes the study found that, both methods resulted in a highly uniform distribution, with RSPS slightly more uniform than FSPS (94.6% versus 93.7%). While the study also focused on the effect of wind and overlapping sprinkler arrays, the methods and materials of the sprinklers are more applicable to this report.

The FSPS design involves a water jet impinging on a fixed deflector plate, which then sprays water radially outward in the horizontal plane. The RSPS differs in that the deflector plate rotates when hit with the water jet. The nozzle diameters used in the study for both the FSPS and the RSPS were 3.8, 6.7, and 7.9 mm. The deflector plate is what creates the spray pattern, and different deflectors can result in sprays at different angles. For the FSPS, the deflector had 33 grooves which resulted in flow being divided into 33 streams for the 3.8 mm nozzle. One note from the study was that as the number of grooves in the deflector plate is increased, the drop size (for a set pressure and nozzle diameter) decreases (Kincaid et al. 1996).

### Spring 2018
In Spring 2018, the Trickling Filter team spent a substantial amount of time doing research on the operational difficulties, the kinetics, and typical design parameters of trickling filters. The team aimed to address many of the issues plant operators encounter with trickling filters, like clogging and ponding, lack of moisture in parts of the filter, and general inefficiency of the filter. The two main areas for improvement the team identified were the filter media itself and the distribution system ([Spring 2018 Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/String-Digester/blob/master/Spring%20'18/TricklingFilter_Final_Report.md)).

The team fabricated a bench top model for flow mapping and conducted several rounds of tests to determine the distribution of flow in trickling filters with small rock and marble media. From these experiments, the team noticed that there were significant portions of the media that never got wet and thus concluded that a substantial volume of the trickling filter was unused due to preferential flow. From these tests the team also showed that a uniform packing material is superior to an irregularly shaped material. In an effort to both maximize the surface area to volume ratio and to minimize the footprint of the system by not wasting space, the team shifted focus towards strings as a possible filter media. This concept led the team to start with very preliminary testing of a system that was essentially an overflowing basin with strings submerged at the top, inside the basin, and draped over the sides to guide water down to a collection bucket below (See **Figure 2.**, the same experimental set-up used in Spring 2018). In these initial tests, the team members observed that the water did in fact follow the along strings when it overflowed. From these observations, the String Digester team began to design more rigorous tests on the concept and planned to investigate whether using strings in a wastewater treatment system is truly viable.

### Fall 2018
In Fall 2018, the team continued experimentation with the overflowing basin from the previous semester. The string yarn was abandoned due to its degradability. Nylon, polypropylene, and a stainless steel wire and cable were first tested on the same set-up from Spring 2018 with the overflowing basin. The plastics were chosen for their non-biodegradability; however, the stainless steel wires may be susceptible to corrosion. All of the preceding materials did not perform well on the basin set-up as the water did not follow the strands due to their hydrophobicity.

Next, two foams and two stainless steel chains were tested on the same basin in addition to a winged basin set up. These materials were able to retain water as it trickled down. The blue foam worked exceptionally well as it absorbed water. The initial testing done on these materials suggests they could work in the proposed system and make the string digester technology possible. Further testing will be done on the chains as the foams are thought to easily clog; therefore, they are not confirmed to be a viable solution at this point. See [Fall 2018 Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/String-Digester/blob/master/Fall%20'18/Final_Report_stringdigester.md) for more information.

### Spring 2019

to be continued!!!!!

Following the conclusion from Fall 2018, that metal chains would be a viable trickling media due to their retention of water, the team decided to focus this semester's research on trying to determine what material and type of chain would work best in terms of water retention and biofilm growth and from there, determining the best matrix for these chains to be in to maximize water retention on chain media. In addition, the team focused on two polymer strings: dacron and aramid as they are both more hydrophilic in structure and therefore the team hoped they would retain water better.

In spring 2019, the subteam focused it's research on identifying a material that would be a feasible option for a trickling filter. The ideal material is hydrophillic, has a high residence time for water, and can support biofilm growth. The materials under consideration were metal chain with different size chain links, Dacron string (polyethylene ?), and Aramid string. The subteam


The subteam tested more materials, dacron and aramid strings, calculated their retention times, the max amount of water that could be held on a chain, and the height needed for 15 min residence time.
- identify and compare the water retention of multiple chains in the same basin of water.
- theoretical efficiency of a string digester: "The goal of this portion was to determine theoretically if a string digester would be more cost and space efficient than current trickling filter technologies."
- The goal of this experiment was to determine if capillary action is possible using the 0.3 mm Dacron string.
