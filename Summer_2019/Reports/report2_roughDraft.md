# Report 2 Rough Draft

## Experiment 1.1

### Methods
The subteam wanted to know if red dye could be used to determine how much water flowed down each string. It was hypothesized that strings exposed to the red dye longer would be darker in color. Three strings were submerged in a container of red dye solution for 10 seconds, 1 minute, and 5 minutes. Afterwards the color of the strings was compared.

### Materials
- 3 short pieces of loopy yarn
- water containing red dye (exact concentration unknown)
- large container
- tape
- white paper

### Procedure
- fill the container with red dye solution. The concentration of dye should be high enough that it is clearly visibly on a string
- submerge one end of each string in the dye, and tape the dry end to the edge of the bucket for easy removal
- Remove the first string after 10 seconds, the second after 1 minute, and the third after 5 minutes
- carefully dab any excess dye off on a paper towel and place the strings next to each other on a piece of paper for comparison

### Results and Analysis
There was no visually distinguishable difference in color between the three strings as seen in **Figure _:**. This meant that the color of a string could not be used to gauge how much water flowed down it. However, the red dye could still be used to determine if water flowed down a string at all.

 **Figure _:** This image shows the color of three strings submerged in red dye for 10 seconds, 1 minute, and 5 minutes, from top to bottom, respectively.

## Experiment 1.4

### Methods
An experiment was conducted to explore the relationship between the density of strings on the main rod, and the fraction of strings that receive water. Previously, the subteam observed that too few strings caused water to preferentially flow to the right side of the matrix, while too many strings caused water to preferentially flow to the left side of the matrix. The subteam hypothesized that an ideal string density exists that would maximize the percentage of strings receiving water.

The subteam attempted to find this ideal string density, by gradually increasing the number of strings wrapped on a fixed length of the main rod. Densities of 12, 18, 22.5, 24, and 30 strings/cm were used. For each trial, a red-dye solution was dripped onto the string target area and the number of strings that water travelled down was recorded. The strings were categorized on a scale of 0 to 2. Zero indicated no flow (a completely white string), 1 indicated partial flow (part of the string was red or pink), and 2 indicated full flow (the entire string was red). To clarify, only the string between the two sets of beaded rods was used in this analysis, as seen in **Figure _**

 </p>

**Figure _:** Only the middle portion of the string matrix, indicated by the red box, was taken into account when determining if water had flowed down the string.

### Materials
- string matrix
- loopy yarn
- water containing red dye (exact concentration unknown)
- large container
- 1 mL pipette

### Procedure
- wrap the matrix with the correct number of strings: either 18, 27, 36, or 45. Each row of strings should only use 9 rods, and the rest should be left empty.
- Number each row of strings from outermost bead to the bead closest to the plywood, and each column from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod in a table
- measure the width of the line of strings at the top, middle, and bottom of the target area and adjust it to be 1.5 cm.
- pour water over the string matrix until all strings are thoroughly wet
- Use a small pipette to repeatedly apply drops of the red dye solution to the string target area
  - moving from the front to the back, apply 5 evenly-spaced drops of water across the line of strings
  - drop should be applied slowly enough that no large droplets are observed flowing down the strings.
  - add a total of 11 pipette-fulls of water (about 11 mL)
- Place a white sheet of paper or plastic behind the outermost row of strings and record the amount of red dye on each string in a table with one of the following descriptions: No flow (no red dye on string); Partial flow (red dye on part of the string); or Flow (red dye on entire length of string)
- Once observations have been recorded for a layer of strings, unwind that layer and make observations for the next layer underneath
- calculate the percentage of strings that received water for each trial (ie. strings labeled 1 or 2), and the percentage of strings that were completely covered in dye (ie. strings labeled 2 only)

### Results and analysis

**Table _:** This table shows the average percentages of strings that received water or that were completely covered with dye. The number of trials conducted for each string density are 3, 3, 1, 3, and 2 respectively.
| String Density (strings/cm) | Average percentage of strings that received water | Average percentage of strings that were completely covered with dye |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|12|83.3|57.4|
|18|93.3|63.7|
|22.5|57.8|17.8|
|24|94.8|69.4|
|30|100|90.0|

**Need to talk about the diagram below**

**Figure _:** This collection of diagrams shows the distribution of water across the string matrix for different densities of strings wrapped around the main rod. Each box represents one string, and the color represents the amount of red dye that remained on that string at the end of the experiment. The top of each diagram corresponds to the outermost row of beads/strings, and the bottom of each diagram corresponds to the innermost row of beads/strings closest to the plywood.

The results for the 22.5 strings/cm density were much lower than any other trial. These results were called into question, because only one trial was conducted. Additionally, the 22.5 strings/cm density was achieved accidentally, because the length of the strings on the rod was not adjusted properly to 1.5 cm before the trial began. There were supposed to be 45 strings in 1.5 cm, but instead there were 45 strings in 2 cm.

**Need to analyze code with python**
Disregarding the 22.5 strings/cm trial, there was a trend


This experiment could be improved by completing more trials of each string density as well as testing higher string densities above 30 strings/cm.

### Conclusions


## Experiment 1.5

### Methods
An alternative method was used to observe preferential flow in the string matrix. For this procedure, a high concentration of red dye was applied to the string target area and about 5 mL of water was added above it using a pipette. Pictures were taken to record the subsequent pattern of red dye that flowed down the strings.

### Materials
- loopy yarn
- string matrix
- 1 mL pipette
- red dye solution (40 g/mL used)
- large bucket

### Manual
- wind string matrix with 5 rows of 9 strings (ie. using 5 beads on 9 pairs of rods) leaving the remaining rods and beads empty
- place the bucket under the string matrix to contain water flow
- For Trial 1, compress the width of the strings on the main rod to 2 cm, and for Trial 2 and Trial 3 compress it to 1.5 cm
- pour water over the string matrix until all strings are thoroughly wet
- add 5-6 drops of highly concentrated red dye (40 g/mL) to the bottom of the target area of the Strings
- apply 5 mL of water to the string target area *above* the location of the red dye with a clean pipette. Disperse 5 drops at a time across the target area, moving from the outer end of the rods towards the plywood.
- observe the subsequent flow of dye down the strings and take pictures of the resulting dye pattern

### Results and Analysis

In all trials, water appeared to 'jump' from one string to another when it came in contact with the beaded rods. This behavior is apparent in **Figure _**, where some strings are completely white above the beads, but red below the beads.

**Figure _:** This image shows the front of the string matrix after Trial 1. The red dye indicates places where water flowed.

The red line in **Figure _** shows where a large drop of water ran down a particular string in the front-center of the string matrix. This occurred in almost the same exact location for both Trial 2 and Trial 3.

**Figure _:** In this image of Trial 3, the red line of dye indicates where a large drop of water ran down the string matrix.

The subteam originally believed that the transfer of water between strings would lead to preferential flow. However, this experiment revealed that water transfer can actually lead to a more even distribution of water. In the rightmost row of strings in **Figure _**, only 2 strings show a solid line of red from the point of application to the bottom of the string matrix. However, because of the beaded rods, a total of 6 strings ended up with water flowing down them by the time it reached the bottom of the matrix.

 </p>

**Figure _:** This picture shows the right-hand side of the string matrix after Trial 1. Above the beaded rods, only 2 strings are covered in dye as shown by the yellow numbering. However, below the beads, all 5 strings in the row are red, indicated by blue numbering.

### Conclusions
The results of this test suggest that the beaded rods help distribute water more evenly among strings. **To be continued...**

A more quantitative version of this test could be conducted by measuring the distance that the red dye traveled down each string.
