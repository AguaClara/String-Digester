# Report 2 Rough Draft

## Experiment 1.1

### Methods
The subteam wanted to know if red dye could be used to determine how much water flowed down each string. It was hypothesized that strings exposed to the red dye longer would be darker in color. Three strings were submerged in a container of red dye solution for 10 seconds, 1 minute, and 5 minutes. Afterwards the color of the strings was compared.

### Materials
- 3 short pieces of loopy yarn
- water containing red dye (exact concentration unknown)
- large container
- tape
- white paper

### Procedure
- fill the container with red dye solution. The concentration of dye should be high enough that it is clearly visibly on a string
- submerge one end of each string in the dye, and tape the dry end to the edge of the bucket for easy removal
- Remove the first string after 10 seconds, the second after 1 minute, and the third after 5 minutes
- carefully dab any excess dye off on a paper towel and place the strings next to each other on a piece of paper for comparison

### Results and Analysis
There was no visually distinguishable difference in color between the three strings as seen in **Figure _:**. This meant that the color of a string could not be used to gauge how much water flowed down it. However, the red dye could still be used to determine if water flowed down a string at all.

 **Figure _:** This image shows the color of three strings submerged in red dye for 10 seconds, 1 minute, and 5 minutes, from top to bottom, respectively.

## Experiment 1.4

### Methods
An experiment was conducted to explore the relationship between the density of strings on the main rod, and the fraction of strings that receive water. While setting up the main apparatus, the subteam observed that too few strings caused water to preferentially flow to the right side of the matrix, while too many strings caused water to preferentially flow to the left side of the matrix. The subteam hypothesized that an ideal string density existed that would maximize the percentage of strings that received water.

### Results and analysis

| String Density (strings/cm) | Average percentage of strings that received water | Average percentage of strings that were completely covered with dye |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|12|83.3|57.4|
|18|93.3|63.7|
|22.5|57.8|17.8|
|24|94.8|69.4|

### Conclusions


## Experiment 1.5

### Methods
An alternative method was used to observe preferential flow in the string matrix. For this procedure, a high concentration of red dye was applied to the string target area and about 5 mL of water was added above it using a pipette. Pictures were taken to record the subsequent pattern of red dye that flowed down the strings.

### Materials
- loopy yarn
- string matrix
- 1 mL pipette
- red dye solution (40 g/mL used)
- large bucket

### Manual
- wind string matrix with 5 rows of 9 strings (ie. using 5 beads on 9 pairs of rods) leaving the remaining rods and beads empty
- place the bucket under the string matrix to contain water flow
- For Trial 1, compress the width of the strings on the main rod to 2 cm, and for Trial 2 and Trial 3 compress it to 1.5 cm
- pour water over the string matrix until all strings are thoroughly wet
- add 5-6 drops of highly concentrated red dye (40 g/mL) to the bottom of the target area of the Strings
- apply 5 mL of water to the string target area *above* the location of the red dye with a clean pipette. Disperse 5 drops at a time across the target area, moving from the outer end of the rods towards the plywood.
- observe the subsequent flow of dye down the strings and take pictures of the resulting dye pattern

### Results and Analysis

In all trials, water appeared to 'jump' from one string to another when it came in contact with the beaded rods. This behavior is apparent in **Figure _**, where some strings are completely white above the beads, but red below the beads.

**Figure _:** This image shows the front of the string matrix after Trial 1. The red dye indicates places where water flowed.

The red line in **Figure _** shows where a large drop of water ran down a particular string in the front-center of the string matrix. This occurred in almost the same exact location for both Trial 2 and Trial 3.

**Figure _:** In this image of Trial 3, the red line of dye indicates where a large drop of water ran down the string matrix.

The subteam originally believed that the transfer of water between strings would lead to preferential flow. However, this experiment revealed that water transfer can actually lead to a more even distribution of water. In the rightmost row of strings in **Figure _**, only 2 strings show a solid line of red from the point of application to the bottom of the string matrix. However, because of the beaded rods, a total of 6 strings ended up with water flowing down them by the time it reached the bottom of the matrix.

**Figure _:** This picture shows the right-hand side of the string matrix after Trial 1. Above the beaded rods, only 2 strings are covered in dye as shown by the yellow numbering. However, below the beads, all 5 strings in the row are red, indicated by blue numbering.

### Conclusions
The results of this test suggest that the beaded rods help distribute water more evenly among strings. **To be continued...**

A more quantitative version of this test could be conducted by measuring the distance that the red dye traveled down each string.
