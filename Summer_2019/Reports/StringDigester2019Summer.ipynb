        "The String Digester Summer 2019 subteam continued research on designing a new trickling filter to eliminate problems associated with conventional designs. Experiments this summer focused on designing a water distribution system that does not encourage preferential flow, and creating a matrix of strings using \"loopy yarn\" as the filter media. An ideal string digester would distribute water uniformly onto a large number of densely packed strings from a spray. Initial testing demonstrated that a 'good' spray can be achieved with flow rates on the order of 10 μL/s, which is the amount needed to ensure proper cleaning by a biofilm. However, further experimentation is needed to improve the spray pattern geometry and to test the matrix of strings for preferential flow. The long-term goal of this team is to create an efficient wastewater treatment system that will perform secondary and tertiary treatment on domestic wastewater. "

        "\n",
        "The String Digester sub-team was created in response to the need for additional wastewater treatment after treatment from the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. A trickling filter is a secondary wastewater treatment system that removes organic matter from the wastewater through biological means, and is crucial for the removal of harmful pathogens. The goal of the String Digester subteam is to design a new trickling filter using strings as media that addresses the expensive nature and inefficiency of conventional designs. Current trickling filters utilize a large mechanical distributor arm to spray water onto filter media, which clogs easily and distributes water unevenly. Additionally, preferential flow creates large inefficiencies intrickling filter operation. \n",
        "\n",
        "[//]: <> (The last sentence on preferential flow feels out of place. I suggest eliminating the mention of preferential flow here and just state that the uneven distribution causes inefficiency since you are talking about it next paragraph anyways)\n",
        "\n",
        "The subteam aimed to increase space efficiency by using a matrix of densely packed strings as the filter media. Creating a string matrix unit that can be replicated for any number of strings is one challenge the subteam faced. Additionally, the subteam began designing 2 systems to distribute water uniformly over this matrix in a way that will decrease the effect of preferential flow, eliminate the need for small orifices, and meet predicted flow volume demands. Like conventional trickling filters, the subteam's first design incorporates a sprinkler system - however the teams solution to creating a spray pattern was to impinge a stream of water on a flat surface that will act as a deflector plate rather than spray water through a small hole. This solution will require research on the formation of spray patterns and how water droplets adhere to the chosen filter media as well as designing a way to implement a string digester into a future AguaClara plant. The subteam's second design consists of a basin covered with holes on the bottom which guide water onto strings hanging from them. This design involves small holes, and will therefore only be feasible if a simple method for cleaning them or preventing clogging is developed.\n",
        "\n",
        "[//]: <> (Explain more about the challenge before talking about the design)\n",
        "\n",
        "Research dealing with trickling filter wastewater treatment was ubiquitous in the 1970's and 1980's, however, the research in this field significantly declined in the following decades. Moreover, research involving string as a media in this method of treatment is almost nonexistent. Research on secondary wastewater treatment originally focused on performance of trickling filters, but now has shifted towards processes that require higher energy consumption. The philosophy for AguaClara plants is to create a plant that is optimized for low cost and high performance. Looking at the regions a future wastewater plant would serve, trickling filters are a promising technology due to their low-energy requirements. By researching methods to increase the efficiency in these plants, these treatment systems have the potential to fit AguaClara's plant philosophy, which is a priority in the team's work in designing the reactor.Improved trickling filter treatment system carries much potential to be implemented in areas of the world in which capital expenditure is a major barrier for employing traditional secondary wastewater treatment (aeration tanks).\n",
        "\n",
        "The subteam's main design for a trickling filter is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Water is pumped into a holding tank containing a small orifice, suspended over a deflecting plate. Upon hitting the plate, the water creates a flat but wide spray that comes into contact with a main rod. This rod is wrapped with string at such a high density that it forms a solid wall of string. Each time the string is wrapped around the rod, it travels through a 'loom' of smaller rods before being wrapped around the main rod again. This creates a rectangular matrix of strings that converges along a main rod. After hitting the wall of string, the water hypothetically divides itself evenly between all strings, and begins to flow downwards. Organic matter is removed from the water by biofilms grown on the strings. Upon reaching the bottom of the string matrix, the water falls off into a collecting basin. **Figure 1** demonstrates this setup, however, more details will be provided in the [Methods](#Methods) section\n",

Additionally, it does not involve any large moving mechanical parts, which are expensive and difficult to maintain. Concern remains, however, that preferential flow will limit the efficiency of this design. "

        "[//]: <> (Write literature review in past tense unless it's a fact or a theory, for example, someone stated not states)\n",
        "The filter media in a conventional trickling filter is usually a material such as rocks, gravel, shredded PVC bottles, or special pre-formed plastic filter media. Because all these materials are not regularly shaped and wastewater is not distributed exactly equally across the top of the media, the water follows the paths of least resistance and preferential flow occurs. Thus, there is wasted space in the filter that remains dry and unused. This leads to a less efficient treatment of organic matter than if all of the space in the filter were utilized. Spuhler recommends using specially manufactured plastic media, like corrugated plastic sheets or even hollow plastic cylinders, to optimize surface area for biofilm formation and allow for free movement of air [(Spuhler 2018)](https://www.sswm.info/node/8215).\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to non-homogenous distribution of wastewater throughout the filter, there is significant documentation of other problems plant operators experience when dealing with trickling filters. Ali and co-authors state that one major problem is clogging and ponding occurring within the filter media due to high biomass sloughing rate. In the context of a trickling filter, sloughing refers to when a layer of the microbial growth loses the ability to stay attached and is shed from the filter media and washed away by water flow. If the layer of biofilm is not maintained at a desired thickness, treatment performance will decrease. Clogging results in a decreased efficiency of treatment and if it is not addressed, the quality of the effluent will suffer. Current solutions include flashing with low doses of chlorine to remove deposited solids and kill excess biomass or periodic flooding [(Ali et al. 2017)](http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/26.6/Pol.J.Environ.Stud.Vol.26.No.6.2431-2444.pdf). The team aims to avoid the problem altogether by using chains and having a media that will not clog up. It is still an important factor to consider in the design because any small slots or holes that the wastewater travels through in the system will likely clog up with biofilm growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ali also states that the aforementioned sloughing and clogging is often caused by uneven hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Hydraulic loading rate is the amount of flow arriving at the treatment plant and going entering the treatment process at any given time. Uneven HLR is caused by clogging of the distribution arm and an uneven distribution of influent. Therefore, proper distribution of wastewater onto the filter media is crucial for optimizing efficiency of treatment. The most common method of influent distribution is rotating distributors. Rotating distributors consist of moving parts that require more maintenance and may be a burden in a plant to operators. Additionally, this system will not serve the chain-focused design.\n",
        "\n",
        "The less common method of distribution, the fixed distribution system as seen below (**Figure 2**), utilizes lateral and main distribution pipes, which are placed just above the trickling filter medium and spaced to give uniform distribution of water. The pipes generally have nozzles with a circular hole and a deflector. This method is commonly used with intermittent dosing, meaning flow from the system varies; it starts at a maximum and lowers as the tank empties. Currently, fixed distribution systems are mostly used in deep filter and biotowers (i.e. very tall filters). Since this method is non-rotating, it may be more applicable for the proposed use of a chain media. However, Sperling and colleagues showed that both the fixed and rotating distribution systems have an inconsistent hydraulic load of the influent [(Sperling 2007)](https://www.iwapublishing.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/9781780402123.pdf). Therefore, the distribution system is another area where there is huge potential for the team to increase the productivity of trickling filters.\n",

        "Although there are multiple problems with trickling filters, one main advantage of trickling filters is that they have a relatively low residence time. This is a consideration which the team should plan to maintain in future designs. Hinton and Stensel measured residence time per unit length of between 30 and 40 sec/m with dye tests. Their predicted residence times, calculated from laminar flow theory, were closer to about 15 sec/m. The authors attributed this discrepancy to \"dye sorption and desorption by the biofilm.\" In either case, the residence time for a 5 meter deep trickling filter would be well under 5 minutes [(Hinton and Stensel 1991)](https://ac.els-cdn.com/0043135491901179/1-s2.0-0043135491901179-main.pdf?_tid=e8d2db22-8e0f-4d3c-a421-352ef74e6f5e&acdnat=1540500088_4808114af12660c061fbd139ac0fbd33). This short treatment time makes trickling filters an appealing wastewater treatment option if problems such as uneven HLR and clogging can be minimized.\n",

        "### Water Distribution\n",
        "Uniform water distribution is essential for many applications such as irrigation and water treatment. One common method for distributing water over a relatively large area is using a spray. There are several different methods for creating a spray, two being the Fixed Spray Plate Sprinklers (FSPS) and Rotating Spray Plate Sprinklers (RSPS). A comparative study conducted by [Faci et al. (2001)](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9437%282001%29127%3A4%28224%29) found that both methods resulted in a highly uniform distribution, with RSPS slightly more uniform than FSPS (94.6% versus 93.7%). While the study also focused on the effect of wind and overlapping sprinkler arrays, the methods and materials of the sprinklers are more applicable to this report.\n",
        "\n",
        "The FSPS design involves a water jet impinging on a fixed deflector plate, which then sprays water radially outward in the horizontal plane. The RSPS differs in that the deflector plate rotates when hit with the water jet. The nozzle diameters used in the study for both the FSPS and the RSPS were 3.8, 6.7, and 7.9mm. The deflector plate is what creates the spray pattern, and different deflectors can result in sprays at different angles. For the FSPS, the deflector had 33 grooves which resulted in flow being divided into 33 streams for the 3.8mm nozzle. One note from the study was that as the number of grooves in the deflector plate is increased, the drop size (for a set pressure and nozzle diameter) decreases [(Kincaid et al. 1996)](https://elibrary.asabe.org/azdez.asp?JID=3&AID=27568&CID=t1996&v=39&i=3&T=1&refer=7&access=&dabs=Y).\n",
        "\n",
        "For each of the sprinkler types, the distribution pattern was observed in varying wind conditions (low wind and medium wind) and with the sprinkler at different heights (1m and 2.5m) above the ground. Figure 2 shows that the RSPS results in a distribution with the highest density at the center (directly under the sprinkler) with the water density decreasing gradually as the radius from the center increases. However the FSPS results in a maximum density in a circular crown several meters from the center where the sprinkler is located. This difference in precipitation patterns is caused by the variation in the size of droplets from an RSPS (which can travel a wide range of distances depending on droplet diameter) compared with the relatively uniform droplet size from an FSPS.\n",

As the sprinkler height from the ground increases, the total wetted area increases as drops emitted in the horizontal direction are able to travel a longer distance. However, drops traveling further have a tendency to drift or evaporate causing less uniformity in the sprinkler distribution, especially at higher wind speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "While sprinklers create a uniform spray pattern that can be manipulated by varying parameters such as droplet size, nozzle diameter, and sprinkler height, sprinklers also require small orifices which may not be feasible with wastewater. However the methods used to spray water outward in the radial direction could be useful when designing a system to spray water in a specific pattern, such as a straight line, and the methods used to split a water stream into several smaller jets may be applicable to future string digester designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Orifice\n",
        "Torricelli's principle relates the velocity of water exiting an orifice, *v*, with water height, *h*, above the orifice; *g* is acceleration due to gravity. $$v = \\sqrt{2gh}$$ From this relation, multiplying by the area of the orifice and further multiplying by a constant, called the vena contracta, $\\pi_{vc}$, that takes into acount the narrowing of the flow as it exits from the orifice, gives the flow rate from the orifice. **Equation 1:**\n",
        "$$Q = \\pi_{vc}A_{orifice}\\sqrt{2gh}$$ \n",
        "With this relation, given the flow requirement of 10𝜇L per string and the estimation of 300 strings per person (see Analysis of Literature), the total flow rate for the reactor can be calculated for a certain number of people. This equation can be used to determine the height of water necessary to produce a particular flow rate, given an orifice large enough to avoid clogging. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Biofilm Growth\n",
        "A component of the string digester that is crucial to its success is the growth of biofilm on the chains. \"A biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells that is irreversibly associated (not removed by gentle rinsing) with a surface and enclosed in a matrix of primarily polysaccharide material.\" [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) Biofilm attachment is a complex process regulated by diverse characteristics of the growth medium, substratum, and cell surface. Biofilm on trickling filters is composed of a variety of organisms and are typically enclosed in a polysaccharide. The biofilm matrix may also contain mineral crystals, corrosion particles, and clay or silt particles. In conclusion, biofilms in wastewater systems are often highly complex [(Donlan 2002).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)\n",
        "\n",
        "Some testing has been done of the growth of biofilm in different surfaces. One study compared growth on glossy electro-polished, bright annealed stainless steel to matte stainless steel and to PVC. The paper notes that stainless steel is hydrophilic and PVC is hydrophobic. In the last 45 days of the 167 day experiment, the matte steel had about 1.44 times more microorganisms than the electro-polished steel, and there was no significant difference between the PVC and polished steel. In discussion of why this occurs, Pedersen cites two reasons: \"detachment due to shear forces from the flow will be reduced on the rougher surface since cells can be shielded from the bulk flow and more substratum surface area may be available for the biofilm\" [(Pedersen 1990).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/)\n",
        "\n",
        "[Above review of biofilm from [Spring 2019 Final Report](https://github.com/AguaClara/String-Digester/blob/master/Spring%202019/String_Digester_Final_Report.md)]\n",
        "\n",
        "### String reaeration\n",
        "For strings to be a viable filter media in a string digester, the wastewater being treated must be exposed to a sufficient amount of oxygen. Whether reaeration occurs as water flows slowly down a string is an important question Krasnoff and Lee answered in their report [Potential Aeration of Water Trickling Down a String](https://github.com/monroews/CEE3530/blob/master/Projects/2019/1Project.pdf). The experiments performed in this investigation into the aeration of water as it flows down a string included testing two different types of string - a flat string and the loopy yarn. By observing dissolved oxygen (DO) levels for varying amounts of COD (chemical oxygen demand) from $Na_{2}SO_{3}$, it was concluded that aeration can occur when water trickles down both the flat string and the loopy yarn. \n",
        "\n",
        "A second set of trials where the COD level was kept constant at 200 mg/L tested the aeration potential at three different flow rates. As expected the slowest flow rate resulted in the highest levels of DO since the water had the most time for aeration to occur on the string. In each case, the loopy yarn had higher levels of DO and it was shown that the loopy yarn still allowed for significant aeration at high flow rates whie the flat string did not (reaeration of the loopy yarn occurred for flow rates ranging from 1.75 to 17.2 μL/s). This means the loopy yarn is a more promising string digester filter media because a higher flow rate will increase the efficiency of the reactor without sacrificing the treatment. The higher rate of aeration in the yarn is attributed to it being hydrophilic and having \"loops\" that allow water drops to briefly collect. \n",
        "\n",
        "The results from these experiments show that a string digester is possible in terms of the aeration of water as it flows down a string. The type of string, the flow rate, and the level of COD are other variables that were proven to impact the degree of aeration and further tests with these parameters in mind would potentially lead to an ideal material and flowrate to consider for a working wastewater treatment plant. While the loopy yarn is promising in lab conditions, the biodegradability of acrylic yarn is something to consider. Under the conditions of a string digester, each strand of filter media will need to withstand a near constant flow of wastewater as well as host a biofilm for proper treatment. Further research into the effects of biofilm growth on several materials with the same \"loopy\" properties as the yarn will be needed. \n",

        "As demonstrated by Krasnoff and Lee in their [report](#String-reaeration) on string aeration, an acryclic yarn made of small loops shows strong potential as a filter media material. This material is ideal, because the many loops slow water flow, which would give biofilms enough time to degrade organic matter in the water. Because of this decreased flow rate and ability to reaerate, the loopy yarn was chosen over other materials tested by previous subteams (See  [Previous Work](#Previous-work) for more details on these materials) to be used in Summer 2019 experiments. \n",

        "The [2010 World Water Day Fact Sheet](https://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/water_quality_facts_and_stats3.pdf) reports an annual wastewater production of 1500 km^3 in 2003. For a  6.4 billion population in 2003, this translates to a waste water production rate of 7.50 mL/s per person. A more recent [source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283744445_Global_Wastewater_and_Sludge_Production_Treatment_and_Use) from 2015 reports a municpal wastewater production of 330 km^3.

Professor Weber-Shirk estimated that the average human creates wastewater at a rate of 3 mL/s, or 3000 microliters/second. The research in the above paragraph supports this estimate, as the calculated values are on the same order of magnitude. If the flowrate down each string is 10 microliters per second, each person would need 300 strings to keep up with their own wastewater production. Therefore a population of 10,000 people would need a trickling filter composed of 3 million strings.\n",

In an effort to maximize the surface area to volume ratio, and to minimize the footprint of the system by not wasting space, the team shifted focus towards strings as a possible filter media. This concept led the team to start with very preliminary testing of a system that was essentially an overflowing basin with strings submerged at the top, inside the basin, and draped over the sides to guide water down to a collection bucket below (See **Figure 4**, the same experimental set-up used in Spring 2018). In these initial tests, the team observed that the water followed the along strings when it overflowed. From these observations, the String Digester team began to design more rigorous tests on the concept and planned to investigate whether using strings in a wastewater treatment system is truly viable.\n",

Nylon, polypropylene, and a stainless steel wire and cable were first tested on the same set-up from Spring 2018 with the overflowing basin. The plastics were chosen for their non-biodegradability; however, the stainless steel wires may be susceptible to corrosion. None of the preceding materials performed well on the basin set-up as the water did not follow the strands due to their hydrophobicity.\n",

The blue foam absorbed water especially well. The initial testing done on these materials suggests they could work in the proposed system and make the string digester technology possible. Further testing will be done on the chains as the foams are thought to easily clog; therefore, they are not confirmed to be a viable solution at this point.

The subteam investigated several chains with different sized chain-links, before switching to more hydrophylic polymers: Dacron (polyethylene terephthalate) and Aramid strings. In order to ensure proper microbe digestion by the biofilms, the Spring 2019 subteam was recommended a residence time of 15 minutes on each string for the water. The subteam calculated the string length needed for a 15 minute residence time for each material, as well as the water retention of multiple chains in the same basin. The subteam identified the Dacron string as having the most potential for a string digester as water flowed down it relatively uniformly and it only required a height of 1.97 m for a 15 min residence time. The Dacron string was used to test whether capillary action could be implemented as a water distribution system. Finally, the subteam calculated the theoretical efficiency (BOD removal per unit area) of a string digester and found that it compared with or exceeded traditional low-rate and high-rate trickling filters.

        "  ## Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "The Summer 2019 subteam researched design parameters for the trickling filter and began building a prototype for initial testing. Two designs were considered as outlined in the [Introduction](#Introduction) section: a converging strings design, and a basin with holes design. Specifically, the subteam addressed the maximum angle needed to keep water on the loopy yarn, the minimum flow rate to produce a 'good' spray, and  the maximum string density possible. These design questions, among others, will be elaborated on in the following paragraphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Design Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Maximum flow rate on each string\n",
        "\n",
        "Previous research conducted by members of CEE 4530 used flow rates ranging from 1.75 to 17.2 microliters/second to test the aeration of water on the loopy yarn. This was used as a basis for selecting 10  μL/s  as the maximum flow rate on each string. Additionally, this number was consistent with the low flow rates calculated by the Spring 2019 subteam needed to achieve a 15 minute residence time. \n",
        "\n",
        "####  Maximum angle needed to keep water on a string\n",
        "\n",
        "The converging strings design requires water to drip down strings displaced at an angle from the vertical position. The subteam hypothesized that there is a maximum string angle beyond which the force of gravity overcomes the adhesion of water to the string, causing the water to fall off the string prematurely instead of flowing all of the way down to the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "To investigate this property, approximately 2 feet of loopy yarn were hung in the air in a vertical position. The peristaltic pump was used with microtubing at 75.0 RPM to supply water to the top of the string. The flow of water was observed as the string was gradually pulled outwards at an angle from its original position. The angle was varied from 0 degrees to slightly less than 90 degrees (about 85 degrees).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Number of Strings that Fit on 1 cm of a Rod\n",
        "\n",
        "The maximum density that the loopy yarn could be packed was acquired experimentally by tightly wrapping it around a thin rod until it coverd 1 cm of the rod's length. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Minimum Spacing Between Strings\n",
        "\n",
        "Several factors were considered when choosing the initial spacing between strings. Due to the vast number of strings required to support a small town, the subteam needed to pack the strings as densely as possible to improve space efficiency. However, if the strings were too close, water droplets could potentially switch from one string to another mid-flow, leading to preferential pathways. The size of a water droplet was estimated to be about 3 mm in diameter. Therfore a string spacing of 5 mm was chosen to avoid unwanted string interaction. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Testing Deflector Plate Geometries\n",
        "\n",
        "Several materials and geometries were tested for use as a deflecting plate. These included PVC pipes cut in half (producing semi-cylinders), PVC sheets of different thicknesses and widths, in addition to a bottle to test a cylindrical shape. For specific dimensions of these materials, please reference the [manual](#Deflector-Plate-Experiments) section. These materials were tested by placing them under running water from the sink and observing the quality of the spray. They were visually evaluated on spray uniformity and width.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, a 'sprinkler head' was fabricated as another deflector plate design. The bottom of a nalgene bottle was removed with a bandsaw. Thin, vertical cuts were made around circumference of the bottle bottom to replicate a Fixed Spray Plate Sprinkler as described in the [Literature Review](#Water-distribution). \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Minimum Flow Rate Needed to Produce a 'Good' Spray\n",
        "\n",
        "The residence time of water on a string could be controlled by either altering the length of each string or the flowrate of water. Using increasingly longer strings to lengthen the residence time is problematic, because a taller filter requires more energy to transport the water to the top for cleaning. Therefore it is important to minimize the flow rate of the spray in order to have more control over the residence time. \n",
        "\n",
        "The subteam defined a good spray pattern as being composed of small droplets uniformly spaced over a large area.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The subteam first used the laboratory sink to identify a baseline flow rate that would produce a 'good' spray. A flat sheet of plastic approximately 1 inch inches in width was held under the faucet as a deflector plate such that the water stream struck the middle of the plate. The same deflector plate was used for all experiments to follow. The strength of the faucet was adjusted until a wide, flat, and even spray was formed. The strength of the faucet was decreased gradually until the water spray could no longer be defined as 'good'. At this point, the deflector plate was removed and the flow rate of the sink was measured by timing how long it took to fill up a 3 liter container. The volume was divided by the time to obtain the flow rate in L/s. This measurement was repeated for a total of 3 times, and the trials were averaged.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this baseline flowrate in mind, an apparatus was built to replicate the spray pattern using water flow due to gravity through an orifice. The end of a clear PVC tube was covered with a hard plastic sheet and glued to form a watertight seal. Four different diameter holes were drilled into the PVC sheet: 7/32\" (5.56 mm), 15/64\" (5.95 mm), 17/64\" (6.75 mm), and 3/8\" (9.53 mm). Any hole that was not being used for a particular trial was temporarily sealed with waterproof tape. The PVC tube, or 'water column' as it will now be referenced as, was measured and marked every centimeter along its length.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the 9.53 mm orifice, Equation 1 was used to calculate the height of water needed in the column to obtain the same flow rate that was used in the sink: 0.1160 L/s. The water column was filled beyond this height and centered over the deflector plate. The spray pattern was observed when the water level reached the calculated height of 28.9 cm.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Decreasing Flow Rate**\n",
        "\n",
        "The subteam wanted to know if a reasonable spray pattern could be produced with an even lower flow rate from the orifice. Decreasing the flowrate was desirable due to the limitation on the number of strings that could be packed into a finite space. With the current flow rate of 0.1160 L/s, a total of 11,600 strings would need to be used to achieve a maximum flow rate of 10 microliters/second per string. With 5 mm spacing between strings, this would cover a square area with 38.1 cm side lengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "The remaining orifice sizes were tested with different flow rates and water heights. The combinations of orifice size, flow rate, and water column height tested are shown in Table 1 below. Due to unnecessary rounding of orifice diameters when using Equation 1, errors existed when calculating the water height needed to achieve a flow rate of 0.05798 L/s. The last column of the table shows the corrected height calculated after experimentation using more precise orifice measurements.\n",

        "For trials 1 and 2, the desired flow rate was initially chosen and the corresponding height of the water column was caluclated. For Trials 3 and 4, the orifice size was pre-selected. The water column was filled to the top and then drained over the deflecting plate. The height of the water in the column was recorded at the last point at which the spray pattern was 'acceptable'. This water height was used to calculate the corresponding flow rate with Equation 1. Additionally, in Trial 4, two different distances between the orifice and the deflecting plate were used: 11 cm and 25 cm. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Varying water velocity**\n",
        "\n",
        "The minimum flow rate to produce a good spray was found to be approximately 0.035 +/- 0.005 L/s. However, these calculations neglected to consider the effect of velocity on spray pattern. The subteam hypothesized that the same quality of spray could be achieved at a lower flow rate by increasing the velocity of water hitting the deflector plate. The velocity of the water was increased by extending the time and distance that it fell from the orifice before hitting the deflecting plate. As the water velocity was more difficult to measure directly, an experiment was conducted to determine the ideal distance between the orifice and deflecting plate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The spray pattern produced by the water column was video recorded as it was repeatedly filled and emptied, with different orifice-deflecting plate distances. Distances of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cm were used with a constant orifice diameter of 5.95 mm. The water height was read off of the PVC tube while it was emptied so that the spray pattern in the video could be associated with a particular flow rate via Equation 1. A tape measure was laid down in the plane of water spray so that the size of the spray could be compared between trials. The videos were analyzed by identifying the water height at which the spray pattern could no longer be defined as 'good'. Python code incorporating Equation 1 was written to calculate the flow rate associated with these water heights.\n",

A threaded rod was inserted into each hole and secured with a nut and washer on either side of the plywood.

Thicker and wider PVC sheets did not produce a good spray pattern, because the spray was highly uneven and a large portion of water dribbled away in an unwanted direction. The PVC cylinders were preferred over the flat plastic sheet, because it only sprayed water in 1 direction, rather than 2 directions. Furthermore, the 1/4 plastic pipe behaved better than the 1/2 PVC pipe, because less water was deflected backwards and wasted. \n",

        "The 'sprinkler' design also showed potential as a deflector plate. The droplets formed by this geometry were very small and evenly spaced. However, the sprinkler plate filled with water and overflowed, wasting a lot of water. The main problem with this design was that it did not project water in a flat line. Rather, the water was spread over a large circular area, which would be difficult to capture on a solid line of string. It was noted that the bottom of the bottle was not entirely flat and there was a large lip between where the water struck and the edge of the plate. Changing these characteristics could potentially improve the spray pattern. \n",

For example, at a distance of 10 cm, Person 1 and Person 2 disagreed on the minimum height by more than 11 cm. However, as the distance between the orifice and the deflector plate increased, the recorded water heights moved closer and closer together. This instills higher confidence in the results for distances of 30, 40, and 50 cm. The calculated flow rates for these trials were consistently around 10 mL/s. The subteam therfore concluded that the minimum flowrate that could be used to produce a good spray was around 10 mL/s at a height around 30 cm. The minimum height leading to a 10 mL/s flow rate according to Person 1 and Person 2 was chosen due to energy constraints (ie. choosing a higher distance would only require more energy to execute with little gain in spray quality).\n",

        "Several observations were made while building the string matrix, leading to future improvements in the design. \n",
        "\n",
        "First, the strings on the main rod overlapped significantly. A total of 85 strings fit in a distance of 2 cm. That is a string density of 42.5 strings per cm instead of the expected 19 strings per cm. This raises the question of whether overlapping strings prevent the water from being distributed uniformly. The overlapping strings may have been caused by the fact that the apparatus was originally designed for 10 rods rather than 16 rods, and the extra  strings may have forced them to overlap with each other. Future iterations of this design should use the correct number of rods, unless experiments demonstrate that overlapping does not lead to preferential flow. \n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, wrapping the strings in steps 4-6 of **Figure 8** required dexterity. The wrapping would go faster if the two large rods associated with these steps were offset from each other, rather than being in a horizontal line. Finally, the rightmost string was loose in every layer of the matrix since the applied tension did not act towards the beaded rods. This problem could be dealt with by either removing the last string, or adding an extra set of beaded rods on the right end of the matrix for support. \n",
        "\n",
        "After the water was dripped on the main rod for several minutes,  the strings were felt. The strings on the right of the apparatus were wet, while the strings on the left side were almost completely dry. These results indicate that preferential flow was occuring in some capacity. This preferential flow may have been caused by the way in which the strings were wrapped. The wrapping pattern caused the strings to rest at different heights close to the main rod. **Figure 23** shows a side view of the strings where they converged at the main rod. There were distinct peaks and troughs in the 'wall of string': the peaks corresponded to the left half of the string matrix, and the troughs corresponded to the right half of the matrix.

        "## Conclusions\n",
        "This semester the team focused on determining variables and methods for producing a spray that would get the water onto the strings. Many tests performed in the lab sink resulted in a better understanding of how sprays are formed, how they disperse, and what conditions (water height, deflector geometry, distance between water column and deflector) were optimal for creating a spray that could wet a line of strings. The team concluded that a water height of between 10 and 20cm, a 1/4 pipe deflector plate, and a large distance between the water column and the deflector plate would be optimal. \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the spray experiments, the team assembled a preliminary model for the string matrix where water would be sprayed on the strings.Taking a different direction than previous semester, the team stuck with loopy yarn as a filter media after students in CEE 4530 saw success with the yarn in terms of water aeration and volume flowing down each strand. The results from the string angle and converging string experiments were useful in constructing the model. \n",
        "\n",
        "Creating a rapid but efficient string digester would be impactful for the future of AguaClara's involvement in wastewater treatment. String digesters have the potential to greatly decrease the wastewater processing time and also decrease the organic solutes in the effluent. By maximizing potential surface area for the microbes to grow on using strings and sponges, thereby allowing for more microbial digestion of the water, some traditional trickling filter problems would be solved or minimized. Effluent from the UASB will require further treatment and the team believes that a string digester could provide the necessary treatment with minimal energy requirements.\n"

        "The next steps for the team this summer include testing the current apparatus and hopefully perfecting a method to spray water onto a line of strings. \n",
        "\n",
        "Future work for the string digester subteam includes determining the minimum spacing between strings so that water droplets do not flow between strings but the string matrix is as dense as possible. Testing this spacing could involve recreating the current model with smaller beads and rods spaced more tightly. Another consideration for the future is quantifying the flow of water down individual strings to see if preferential flow is occuring and to determine if the actual flow rate is similar to the desired 10𝜇L/s per string. One way to see if water is evenly flowing down all the strings would be to use a colored dye, drip or spray water onto the strings, and observe the flow of the colored water. If preferential flow occurs in the existing design, finding ways to minimize it, if possible, would increase the efficiency of the reactor. \n",
