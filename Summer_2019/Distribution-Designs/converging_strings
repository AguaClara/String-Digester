# Design #1: Converging strings

## Experiment 1

**Goal:** Determine the minimum angle between adjacent strings such that the water travels down them rather than falling off or traveling between 2 strings.

**Setup:**
- Number of strings: 7
- Height of support: 18 cm
- Perpendicular distance from support to strings at the farthest anchor point: 12.5 cm

### Trial 1

#### Setup:
- strings anchored to every other chain link
- Base of "String triangle": 5.5 cm
- height of "string triangle": 18.0 cm from center of base to top of triangle


#### Observations:
- some of the water traveled down the strings (mostly the middle string) while some fell off near the base of the support.
- water often flowed between 2 strings, the surface tension from the water often pulled two strings close together such that they were touching.
- applying tension did not improve flow much. Droplets clearly fell off before reaching the bottom of the string.

#### Conclusions:
- need a wider angle between strings
- also try to increase the tension of the strings

### Trial 2

#### Setup:
- 2 spaces in chainlink between each strings
- Base of "String triangle": 8.5 cm
- height of "string triangle": 24.0 cm from center of base to top of triangle

#### Observations
- water still flows between strings, but there is less string-string interaction.
- larger water droplets caused the strings to interact

#### Conclusions
- consider switching to the persistaltic pump to have a finer control over water input. Perhaps smaller droplets will stick to the string better.
