# Design #1: Converging strings

## Experiment 1

**Goal:** Determine the minimum angle between adjacent strings such that the water travels down them rather than falling off or traveling between 2 strings.

**Setup:**
- Number of strings: 7
- Height of support: 18 cm
- Perpendicular distance from support to strings at the farthest anchor point: 12.5 cm

### Trial 1

#### Setup:
- strings anchored to every other chain link
- Base of "String triangle": 5.5 cm
- height of "string triangle": 18.0 cm from center of base to top of triangle


#### Observations:
- some of the water traveled down the strings (mostly the middle string) while some fell off near the base of the support.
- water often flowed between 2 strings, the surface tension from the water often pulled two strings close together such that they were touching.
- applying tension did not improve flow much. Droplets clearly fell off before reaching the bottom of the string.

#### Conclusions:
- need a wider angle between strings
- also try to increase the tension of the strings

### Trial 2

#### Setup:
- 2 spaces in chainlink between each strings
- Angle between adjacent springs: 5 degrees
- Base of "String triangle": 8.5 cm
- height of "string triangle": 24.0 cm from center of base to top of triangle

#### Observations
- water still flows between strings, but there is less string-string interaction.
- larger water droplets caused the strings to interact

#### Conclusions

### Trial 3

#### Setup:
- 3 spaces in chainlink between each strings
- Angle between adjacent springs: 10 degrees
- used the peristaltic pump at 100 RPM and the microtubing to apply water to strings


#### Observations
- adjacent strings did not get pulled together by the water at this angle, but when water flowed between them, it stills fell off as soon as the distance between the strings got too wide
- making the strings more vertical improved flow downwards but the water was still falling off.

#### Conclusions
- converging strings is not a viable option, because at some distance, the strings will always be close enough for water to flow in between them.
