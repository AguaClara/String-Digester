- Flushing - removing material by closing/opening valves to create aggressive hydraulic forces within selected pipes
- "Research has shown that this cleaning strategy only partially removes biofilms depending on the operating hydraulic regime and biofilms can rapidly regenerate".

- most biofilm clusters can be completely detached by a mechanical shear stress above 250kPa, however the hydrodynamic shear stress applied to obtain these results is very high and technically impossible
- cohesiveness is the key parameter that governs biofilm volume and structure
- biofilm grows more rigid and more resistant to shearing forces under faster and turbulent flow conditions was observed
