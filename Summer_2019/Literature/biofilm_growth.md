# Is there a minimum water velocity at which no biofilms can grow?

- Flushing - removing material by closing/opening valves to create aggressive hydraulic forces within selected pipes
- "Research has shown that this cleaning strategy only partially removes biofilms depending on the operating hydraulic regime and biofilms can rapidly regenerate".

- most biofilm clusters can be completely detached by a mechanical shear stress above 250kPa, however the hydrodynamic shear stress applied to obtain these results is very high and technically impossible
- cohesiveness is the key parameter that governs biofilm volume and structure
- biofilm grows more rigid and more resistant to shearing forces under faster and turbulent flow conditions was observed

- "The experiments showed that a more compact biofilm structure is sloughed off in total with nearly no biomass left on the substratum."
- "the process of sloughing is not occurring within a short time; it rather may take hours or even days
- after sloughing, biofilm growth slowed down
- "It has been proposed, that biofilm sloughing and detachment is typically coupled with a certain biofilm thickness (Picioreanu et al., 2001). In our case, it took 2 days until the biofilm was completely sloughed.""
- A shear stress of 10 - 40 mPa created by biofilm growth caused sloughing. However, another study referenced in the article found that a biofilm could withstand up to 13 Pa of shear stress before "complete detachment"
- In literature the ratio of "wall shear stress/cohesive strength leading to detachment" has been reported in a very wide range (200 - ,1100) meaning that it is very hard to predict an actual value.
 - In this experiment, fluid velocities of 107, 142, and 360 mm/s were used to cause detachment, corresponding to flow rates of 8.7, 11.6, and 29.0 mL/s.
