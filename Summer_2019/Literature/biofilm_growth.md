- Flushing - removing material by closing/opening valves to create aggressive hydraulic forces within selected pipes
- "Research has shown that this cleaning strategy only partially removes biofilms depending on the operating hydraulic regime and biofilms can rapidly regenerate".

- most biofilm clusters can be completely detached by a mechanical shear stress above 250kPa, however the hydrodynamic shear stress applied to obtain these results is very high and technically impossible
- cohesiveness is the key parameter that governs biofilm volume and structure
- biofilm grows more rigid and more resistant to shearing forces under faster and turbulent flow conditions was observed

- "The experiments showed that a more compact biofilm structure is sloughed off in total with nearly no biomass left on the substratum."
- "the process of sloughing is not occurring within a short time; it rather may take hours or even days
- after sloughing, biofilm growth slowed down
- "It has been proposed, that biofilm sloughing and detachment is typically coupled with a certain biofilm thickness (Picioreanu et al., 2001). In our case, it took 2 days until the biofilm was completely sloughed.""
- A shear stress of 10 - 40 mPa created by biofilm growth caused sloughing. However, another study referenced in the article found that a biofilm could withstand up to 13 Pa of shear stress before "complete detachment"
- In literature the ratio of "wall shear stress/cohesive strength leading to detachment" has been reported in a very wide range (200 - ,1100) meaning that it is very hard to predict an actual value.
 - In this experiment, fluid velocities of 107, 142, and 360 mm/s were used to cause detachment, corresponding to flow rates of 8.7, 11.6, and 29.0 mL/s.

 - epilithic (growing on the surface of a rock) biofilm growth was examined at 3 different velocities 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40 m/s
 -  a different indicator taxa was observed for each of the 3 velocity ranges
    - "the indicator taxa were Fragilaria capucinavar.mesoleptain in the low-velocity (u* 0.010-0.012 m s^-1), Navicula atomus, Navicula capitatoradiata, and Nitzschia frustulumin in the intermediate-velocity (u* 0.023-0.030 m s^-1), and Amphora pediculus, Cymbella proxima, Fragilaria capucinavar.vaucheriae, and Surirella angustain in the high-velocity (u* 0.033 0.050 m s^-1) sections." where u* refers to friction velocity which is the shear stress velocity
 - "A sloughing test was performed on 40-day-old biofilms in order to study the resistance of epilithic biofilms to higher hydrodynamic regimes. Theresults showed an inverse relationship between the proportion of detached biomass and the average value of friction velocity during growth. Therefore, water velocity during epi-lithic biofilm growth conditioned the structure and algal composition of biofilm, as well asits response (ability to resist) to higher shear stresses."
 - The flow velocity had a significant effect on biofilm growth at first, but after 3 weeks, the biofilm growth started to even out between flow regimes
 - Different phases of biofilm growth: "after the colonization phase, the general patternobserved was that biofilms developed under lower velocitieswere thicker and had larger surface sinuosity and higher arealdensities than their counterparts exposed to higher velocities.This result has been already observed in other experimentswith microbial biofilms or stream (Battin et al., 2003; Torne ÃÅsand Sabater, 2010)." ie. slow velocity = more compact biofilms
