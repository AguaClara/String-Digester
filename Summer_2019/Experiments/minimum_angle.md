# Minimum Angle Needed for Water to Stay on a String

**Goal:** Determine the minimum angle that a string (specifically loopy yarn) can be displaced from the vertical position such that no water falls off of the string prematurely as it runs down.

## Materials
- 1 piece of loopy yarn
- peristaltic pump connected with microtubing

## Procedure:
- Hang loopy yarn in the air such that it dangles straight downwards
- Use the peristaltic pump at 75.0 rpm to drip water onto the top of the string
- gradually pull the string outwards so that it is at an angle from its original position
- observe the path that the water travels as this angle is increased

## Observations:
The angle of the loopy string was varied from 0 degrees to slightly less than 90 degrees. The water never fell off of the string and followed it all of the way down to the end of the string at all angles in this range.

## Conclusions:
The angle to the string will not prevent water from flowing down it. However, having strings at different angles from the vertical may lead to strong preferential flow, and should be considered further in the designs of the trickling filter.
