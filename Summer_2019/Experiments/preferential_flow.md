# Preferential Flow

## Experiment 1.1

**Goal:** Determine if red dye can be used to determine how much water flows down each string.

**Hypothesis:** Strings that are exposed to the dyed water longer will be darker in color.

**Materials:**
- 3 short pieces of loopy yarn
- red dye
- large container
- tape
- paper

**Procedure:**
- add red dye to the container
- submerge one end of each string in the dye, and tape the dry end to the edge of the bucket for easy removal
- Remove the first string after 10 seconds, the second after 1 minute, and the third after 5 minutes
- carefully dab any excess dye off on a paper towel and place the strings next to each other on a piece of paper for comparison

**Results:**
There was no visually distinguishable difference in color between the three strings (see picture). This means that we cannot use the color of the dye on a string to determine how much water flowed down it. However, we can still use the red dye to determine if water flowed down a string at all.

## Experiment 1.2
**Goal:**
Determine if preferential flow is occurring

**Materials:**
- Current experimental apparatus set up with half-spoon deflector plate
- Red dye (exact concentration not important)
- Large bucket for holding diluted dye solution
- Piece of plastic to stop extra water from dripping on the strings

**Experimental Setup:**
- Fill container with red dye, add water to desired dilution
- Set up strings and spray deflector (spoon) so that the spray hits the tops of the strings
- Hold additional piece of plastic under the deflector spoon to stop water dripping from the sides of the spoon from landing on the strings
- Set up peristaltic pump so red dye solution is pumped into the water column

**Procedure:**
- Turn on peristaltic pump at 150 rpm and begin timer
- Observe how the red dye flows down the strings for 5 min, making sure that the only water flowing down the strings is from the spray at the top of the model
- Stop peristaltic pump
- Label each row 1-11 (from outermost to closest to wood) and the strings on each row 1-17 (left to right)
- Move rows of strings outward on the rods one at a time to observe the amount of red dye on individual strings
- Record the degree of flow down each string in a table with one of the following descriptions: No flow (no red dye on string); Partial flow (red dye on part of the string); or Flow (red dye on entire length of string)
- If it is possible to see different concentrations of red dye (lighter for less flow down a string and darker for more flow), record this as well
