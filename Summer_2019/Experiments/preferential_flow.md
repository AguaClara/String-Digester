# Preferential Flow

## Experiment 1.1

**Goal:** Determine if red dye can be used to determine how much water flows down each string.

**Hypothesis:** Strings that are exposed to the dyed water longer will be darker in color.

**Materials:**
- 3 short pieces of loopy yarn
- red dye
- large container
- tape
- paper

**Procedure:**
- add red dye to the container
- submerge one end of each string in the dye, and tape the dry end to the edge of the bucket for easy removal
- Remove the first string after 10 seconds, the second after 1 minute, and the third after 5 minutes
- carefully dab any excess dye off on a paper towel and place the strings next to each other on a piece of paper for comparison

**Results:**
There was no visually distinguishable difference in color between the three strings (see picture). This means that we cannot use the color of the dye on a string to determine how much water flowed down it. However, we can still use the red dye to determine if water flowed down a string at all.

## Experiment 1.2
**Goal:**
Determine if preferential flow occurs when water is sprayed on the string matrix.

**Materials:**
- Current experimental apparatus set up with half-spoon deflector plate (for a spray width ~ 3-4 cm wide)
- Red dye (exact concentration not important)
- Large bucket for holding diluted dye solution
- Piece of plastic to stop extra water from dripping on the strings

**Experimental Setup:**
- Fill container with red dye, add water to desired dilution
- Set up strings and spray deflector (spoon) so that the spray hits the tops of the strings
- Hold additional piece of plastic under the deflector spoon to stop water dripping from the sides of the spoon from landing on the strings
- Set up peristaltic pump so red dye solution is pumped into the water column

**Procedure:**
- Turn on peristaltic pump at 150 rpm and begin timer
- Observe how the red dye flows down the strings, making sure that the only water flowing down the strings is from the spray at the top of the model
- Stop peristaltic pump when the container of dye is empty, after approximately 5 min.
- Label each row 1-11 (from outermost to closest to wood) and the strings on each row 1-17 (left to right)
- Move rows of strings outward on the rods one at a time to observe the amount of red dye on individual strings. Place white sheet of paper behind each row for better observation
- once observations have been recorded about each row, remove it from the matrix entirely to get it out of the way. Wipe rods down with a paper towel in between rows to avoid contamination.
- Record the degree of flow down each string in a table with one of the following descriptions: No flow (no red dye on string); Partial flow (red dye on part of the string); or Flow (red dye on entire length of string)
- If it is possible to see different concentrations of red dye (lighter for less flow down a string and darker for more flow), record this as well

**Results**
Pictures of the string matrix were taken several times during the experiment. The experiment was run for a total of 5 minutes and 48 seconds.

The following grid describes the amount of red dye on each string. The bolded numbers indicate a row and a column as viewed from the bottom of the string matrix ie. rows moving towards the plywood, and columns moving from left to right

0 = No flow;
1 = Partial flow;
2 = Flow;

The last data point was not recorded for rows 10 and 11 by accident.

There is a clear trend moving from left to right (columns 1-17) across the string matrix. All strings in the first 4 columns (besides in row 11) showed flow on the entire length of the string. In contrast, the right side of the matrix contained a high concentration of strings that showed partial flow or no flow at all. Furthermore, the strings on the right side of the matrix were typically blocked from the spray by other strings that overlapped. The subteam therefore concluded that preferential flow could be further minimized by creating a flatter surface for the water spray to land on, so that no strings were systematically covered from the spray.

## Experiment 1.3

**Goal:** Determine if preferential flow can be reduced by creating a flatter surface for the water spray to land on.

The subteam created a flatter wall of strings by adding a third main rod above the string matrix, in between the two that were already there. Additionally, the rods were moved farther away from the matrix to minimize the difference in angle between strings on the left and right sides of the matrix. To clarify, strings on the right hang practically vertical (angle ~ 0), whereas strings on the left hang are pulled away from the vertical (about 30 degrees. need to actually measure this number!).

Note that this time, the strings were wrapped a lot tighter and flatter so that overlapping was extremely minimal. This meant that the same number of strings (160 strings) took up 4.5 cm of space on the rod instead of 3.5 cm. The spoon was centered on the line of strings, and therefore the strings on either end of the rod may have received less water due to the small spray width.

The subteam repeated the procedure from experiment 1.2 using this new rod layout, and the results of experiment 1.2 and 1.3 were compared.

**Results:**

In this trial, very little water actually ran down the strings. Instead, it collected and dripped off of the first (the lowest) main rod in a continuous stream. Two videos on github show this behavior. This led to most strings having very little or no color at all by the end of the 5 minute experiment. Comparatively, in experiment 1.2, the majority of the strings were a dark pink shade and it was easy to distinguish the strings that did not receive water from those that did.

The subteam decided to repeat this experiment to determine if there was a human error in experimental setup or if the new rod design is not feasible. One hypothesis is that with the new rod design and a flow rate >> 10 microL/s (150 RPM), the strings cannot distribute the water as fast as it is sprayed, and therefore it drips through the wall of strings and onto the table. A potential solution is to decrease the flow rate and test the apparatus at a smaller scale.
