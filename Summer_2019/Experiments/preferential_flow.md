# Preferential Flow

## Experiment 1.1

**Goal:** Determine if red dye can be used to determine how much water flows down each string.

**Hypothesis:** Strings that are exposed to the dyed water longer will be darker in color.

**Materials:**
- 3 short pieces of loopy yarn
- red dye
- large container
- tape
- paper

**Procedure:**
- add red dye to the container
- submerge one end of each string in the dye, and tape the dry end to the edge of the bucket for easy removal
- Remove the first string after 10 seconds, the second after 1 minute, and the third after 5 minutes
- carefully dab any excess dye off on a paper towel and place the strings next to each other on a piece of paper for comparison

**Results:**
There was no visually distinguishable difference in color between the three strings (see picture). This means that we cannot use the color of the dye on a string to determine how much water flowed down it. However, we can still use the red dye to determine if water flowed down a string at all.

## Experiment 1.2
**Goal:**
Determine if preferential flow occurs when water is sprayed on the string matrix.

**Materials:**
- Current experimental apparatus set up with half-spoon deflector plate (for a spray width ~ 3-4 cm wide)
- Red dye (exact concentration not important)
- Large bucket for holding diluted dye solution
- Piece of plastic to stop extra water from dripping on the strings

**Experimental Setup:**
- Fill container with red dye, add water to desired dilution
- Set up strings and spray deflector (spoon) so that the spray hits the tops of the strings
- Hold additional piece of plastic under the deflector spoon to stop water dripping from the sides of the spoon from landing on the strings
- Set up peristaltic pump so red dye solution is pumped into the water column

**Procedure:**
- Turn on peristaltic pump at 150 rpm and begin timer
- Observe how the red dye flows down the strings, making sure that the only water flowing down the strings is from the spray at the top of the model
- Stop peristaltic pump when the container of dye is empty, after approximately 5 min.
- Label each row 1-11 (from outermost to closest to wood) and the strings on each row 1-17 (left to right)
- Place a white sheet of paper or plastic behind the outermost layer of strings and record the amount of red dye on each string in a table with one of the following descriptions: No flow (no red dye on string); Partial flow (red dye on part of the string); or Flow (red dye on entire length of string)
- Once observations have been recorded for a layer of strings, unwind that layer to get it out of the way.
- If it is possible to see different concentrations of red dye (lighter for less flow down a string and darker for more flow), record this as well

**Results**
Pictures of the string matrix were taken several times during the experiment. The experiment was run for a total of 5 minutes and 48 seconds.

The following grid describes the amount of red dye on each string. The bolded numbers indicate a row and a column as viewed from the bottom of the string matrix ie. rows moving towards the plywood, and columns moving from left to right

0 = No flow;
1 = Partial flow;
2 = Flow;

The last data point was not recorded for rows 10 and 11 by accident.

There is a clear trend moving from left to right (columns 1-17) across the string matrix. All strings in the first 4 columns (besides in row 11) showed flow on the entire length of the string. In contrast, the right side of the matrix contained a high concentration of strings that showed partial flow or no flow at all. Furthermore, the strings on the right side of the matrix were typically blocked from the spray by other strings that overlapped. The subteam therefore concluded that preferential flow could be further minimized by creating a flatter surface for the water spray to land on, so that no strings were systematically covered from the spray.

## Experiment 1.3

**Goal:** Determine if preferential flow can be reduced by creating a flatter surface for the water spray to land on.

The subteam created a flatter wall of strings by adding a third main rod above the string matrix, in between the two that were already there. Additionally, the rods were moved farther away from the matrix to minimize the difference in angle between strings on the left and right sides of the matrix. To clarify, strings on the right hang practically vertical (angle ~ 0), whereas strings on the left hang are pulled away from the vertical (about 30 degrees. need to actually measure this number!).

Note that this time, the strings were wrapped a lot tighter and flatter to reduce overlapping. This meant that the same number of strings (160 strings) took up 4.5 cm of space on the rod instead of 3.5 cm. The spoon was centered on the line of strings, and therefore the strings on either end of the rod may have received less water due to the small spray width.

The subteam repeated the procedure from experiment 1.2 using this new rod layout, and the results of experiment 1.2 and 1.3 were compared.

**Results:**

In this trial, very little water actually ran down the strings. Instead, it collected and dripped off of the first (the lowest) main rod in a continuous stream. Two videos on github show this behavior. This led to most strings having very little or no color at all by the end of the 5 minute experiment. Comparatively, in experiment 1.2, the majority of the strings were a dark pink shade and it was easy to distinguish the strings that did not receive water from those that did.

The subteam decided to repeat this experiment to determine if there was a human error in experimental setup or if the new rod design is not feasible. One hypothesis is that with the new rod design and a flow rate >> 10 microL/s (150 RPM), the strings cannot distribute the water as fast as it is sprayed, and therefore it drips through the wall of strings and onto the table. A potential solution is to decrease the flow rate and test the apparatus at a smaller scale, with the strings being in a monolayer, not allowed to overlap at all.

### Trial 2:
The width of the strings on the rod was again condensed to 4.5 cm. (so the strings were still overlapping somewhat)

This test was run for about 7 minutes. Additionally the rightmost string in each row was ignored, because every time the matrix is wrapped it ends up being very loose and the subteam decided not to use it.

The following grid describes the amount of red dye on each string. The bolded numbers indicate a row and a column as viewed from the bottom of the string matrix ie. rows moving towards the plywood, and columns moving from left to right

The location of zeros and ones is also to the right and middle, similarly to Experiment 1.2. However, there are noticeably fewer of them in total. This suggests that the new design may have promoted a more even flow pattern. However, more trials would be needed to confirm whether the design actually distributes water evenly.

### Trial 3:

July 22, 2019

**Adjustments to Experimental Procedure**
Before Trial 3 began all of the strings were wetted very thoroughly (by running the apparatus with clean water for several minutes while dumping buckets of water onto the top of the strings) to eliminate the variable of surface tension. To clarify, in previous trials, the apparatus was only run with clean water before red dye was introduced. This may have encouraged preferential pathways to form since not all of the strings were necessarily coated evenly with water. Then when the red dye was introduced, surface tension may have pulled the water preferentially onto strings that were already wet.

The width of the strings on the rod was unknown at the start of trial 3. This introduced an unwanted variable in the subteam's results, since the strings may have been slightly more spread out in this trial than previous trials.

This test was run for about 7 minutes. Additionally the rightmost string in each row was ignored, because every time the matrix is wrapped it ends up being very loose.

**Observations & Results:**

The spray for this trial was a little off center. It sprayed more on strings that were closer to the front of the matrix, rather than strings that were closer to the plywood. Additionally, large droplets were observed flowing down many strings (video on github). This indicates that the flow rate used in these experiments was too high (>> 10 microL/s), and therefore the observed behavior may differ from what would occur in an actual trickling filter.

The following grid describes the amount of red dye on each string. The bolded numbers indicate a row and a column as viewed from the bottom of the string matrix ie. rows moving towards the plywood, and columns moving from left to right

0 = No flow;
1 = Partial flow;

|**11**|2|2|2|2|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|2|2|1|1|1|

**Conclusions:** Almost all of the strings showed water flow down the entire string. The main exception is the last row of strings that was close to the plywood. The lack of water flow here could be attributed to the off-centered spray pattern, which favored the front of the string matrix. The experiment could be improved by decreasing the flow rate used for testing. The subteam will continue wetting the strings thoroughly before subsequent trials to ensure that the surface tension of water affects all strings the same on average.

### Trial 4 and Additional Notes

In the last trial, there was ambiguity as to whether having the strings more spread out helped distribute the water more evenly among strings. The subteam decided to set up an experiment in which the wall of strings was made extremely flat by packing the strings as tightly as possible without allowing for ANY overlapping. This resulted in a string density of 18 strings in 1.5 cm. The number of strings and flow rate was also scaled down to mimic conditions that would be more realistic for a string digester implemented in a community.

Just some thoughts:
18 strings at 10 microL/s = 180 microL/s = 0.180 mL/s
or 18 strings at 20 microL/s = 360 microL/s = 0.360 mL/s

We can achieve a small flow rate by using intermittent spraying.

60 RPM gives about 4.80 mL/s per flowrate_string_ratios. In order to get a flow rate of 0.180 mL/s, we would need to wait 26.7 s between pulses of water.

The matrix was round with 2 layers of 9 strings, working from left to right, for a total of 18 strings covering 1.5 cm of rod.
The pump was set to 35.0 RPM, to achieve a spray small enough to cover only the width of the string wall.

Initial testing with regular water showed large droplets of water streaming down the strings. This indicates that the flow rates being used are still way too high. Additionally, a much larger stream of water was seen going down the rightmost 2 strings, which was significantly bigger than an of the other strings. These two strings correspond to the two strings exactly in the 'trough' of the string wall. This behavior did not cease even when water was preferentially applied to the left or right side of the string wall, indicating that the string winding pattern itself is a cause for preferential flow. After the water spray hits the strings, it spreads out evenly when it comes in contact with the lowest main rod. However, after this point, the water is preferentially deflected towards the trough of the string wall.

This trial was paused before adding red dye to make adjustments to the experimental methods.

Question: The peaks and troughs of the winding pattern cause water to prefer the right side of the string matrix. Overlapping due to a high winding density prevents strings on the right side of the matrix from receiving water. Therefore, is there an optimal string density that allows all strings to receive an even amount of water?

## Experiment 1.4

**Goal:** Determine the relationship between the density of strings on the main rod, and the fraction of strings that receive water.

**Independent Variable:** number of strings on the main rod (and therefore string density)
- 18 strings/1.5 cm = 12 strings/cm
- 27 strings/1.5 cm = 18 strings/cm
- 36 Strings/1.5 cm = 24 strings/cm

**Procedure:**
- wrap the string matrix with the correct number of strings.
- Measure the width of the line of strings at the top, middle, and bottom of the target area and adjust it to be 1.5 cm.
- Use an eye dropper to repeatedly apply small amounts of water with red dye to the string target area
  - moving from the front to the back, apply 5 evenly-spaced drops of water across the line of strings
  - drop should be applied slowly enough that no large droplets are observed flowing down the strings.
  - add a total of 11 pipette-fulls of water
- record whether or not the string received water, rated on a scale of 0,1, or 2 as in experiments 1.2 and 1.3.
- calculate the percentage of strings that received water for each trial (ie. labeled 1 or 2), and the percentage of strings that were completely covered in dye (ie. labeled 2 only)

**Notes:** the length of strings on the rod was not adjust properly to 1.5 cm before the trial began, leading to the differing string density. Water barely flowed down the strings at all during this trial. ie. it did not even make it to the beads/small rods on the majority of the strings.

## Experiment 1.5

**Goal:** Introduce an alternative method for comparing water flow down each string

**Description:** An alternative method was used to observe preferential flow in the string matrix. For this procedure, a high concentration of red dye was applied to the string target area and about 5 mL of water was added above it using a pipette. Pictures were taken to record the subsequent pattern of red dye that flowed down the strings.

### Procedure:
- wind string matrix with 5 rows of 9 strings (ie. using 5 beads on 9 pairs of rods) leaving the remaining rods and beads empty
- For Trial 1, compress the width of the strings on the main rod to 2 cm, and for Trial 2 and Trial 3 compress it to 1.5 cm
- pour water over the string matrix until all strings are thoroughly wet
- add 5-6 drops of highly concentrated red dye (40 g/mL) to the bottom of the target area of the Strings
- apply 5 mL of water to the string target area *above* the location of the red dye with a clean pipette. Disperse 5 drops at a time across the target area, moving from the outer end of the rods towards the plywood.
- observe the subsequent flow of dye down the strings and take pictures of the resulting dye pattern

### Results and Observations

**Trial 1:**
about 3 mL applied in 1 min 27 sec = 0.0575 mL/s overall = 1.28 microL/s per string. width of strings on rod is 2 cm. 45 strings total = 22.5 strings/cm

**Trial 2:**
String width returned to 1.5 cm and trial 1 procedure repeated. 6 drops dye applied. drops added too fast, one large drop created large red streak between to strings in middle-front of matrix as seen in initial photos on github. Later on in the trial, another large drop travelled down the same string as before.

**Trial 3:**
A large drop followed the same string as in Trial 2 almost immediately after the trial began.

### Conclusions:
In all trials, strings in between the beads showed red dye, even when the water had not actually travelled all of the way down that particular string. This indicates that large droplets of water must be hopping from string to string. The subteam hypothesized that the beaded rods were the cause of this string switching. In some of the pictures on github, there is a very clear line where some of the strings are white above the beads, and red below the beads. The subteam did not measure the actual distance that water travelled down each string and this may be the next step if it is not too logistically difficult.
