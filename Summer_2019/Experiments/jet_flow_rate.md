The best jets observed so far have a narrow stream of water at a high speed. Increasing the height of the water doesn't do much for the speed (under the square root in the orifice equation), need to make the orifice area smaller instead.



3/32



Materials:
Clear PVC tube inner diameter 4.5 cm
Flat sheet of PVC about 8x6.5 cm with a hole drilled in the center about 5.5 mm in diameter\
PVC pipe is glued onto the PVC sheet such that the hole is centered in the middle


Procedure:
Filled the container to a height of 15 cm while the hole was plugged
Unplugged the hole and started a timer while pouring more water in to maintain a height of approximately 15 cm

6/12/19

Hole Size: about 5 mm 7/32" diameter
Trial 1
It took about 5 seconds for approximately 80 mL to drain from the container = 16 mL/s = 16000 microL/s =  water for 1,600 strings
If the strings are 5 mm apart, arranged in a square, the square would have a side length of 200 mm = 20 cm

Trial 2
3 seconds for 90 mL = 30 mL/s


Hole Size: 3/32" diameter  about 2.35 mm diameter

Trial 1: 90 mL in 14.6 seconds = 6.16 mL/s

Find the flowrate of the sink that produces a good flow.

3 trials, to fill 3 Liters of water
Times: 26.53, 26.05, and 25.03 seconds
Average time = 25.87 seconds
Average flow rate = 0.115964 L/s = 0.000115964 m^3/s = 115964 microL/s = 11,596.4 strings
If strings are 5mm apart in a square, square length is = 538 mm long = 53.8 cm long
