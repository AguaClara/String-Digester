# Flowrate : String Ratios

**Peristaltic pump 120 RPM**

7.86 seconds, 80 mL = 10.18 mL/s ~= 1000 strings

**With the spoon**
spray width ~= 3 cm = 18*3 = 54 strings

**with the 1/4 PVC pipe**
spray width ~= 3 cm = 18*3 = 54 strings

Current string density is 42.5 strings/cm wrapped on the matrix
so for 3 cm, there would be 127.5 strings. no where near 1000.

**Peristaltic pump 60 RPM**

89 mL in 18.53 seconds = 4.80 mL/s = 480 strings
