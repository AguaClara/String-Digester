# Moving Target

**Problem Statement:** Water flowing from the orifice does not hit the deflector plate in a constant location. This is a problem, because it makes it very difficult to position the water column over the deflector plate where it will create a good spray. Potential solutions include designing a deflector plate where the 'target area' for the influent water does not need to be as precise, or seeing if any parameters of the experimental apparatus can be changed to make the water positioning more consistent.

**Parameters that may affect water positioning on deflector plate**
- flow rate
- size of the orifice
- distance between the orifice and deflector plate
- uneven pulsing from the peristaltic pump

We observed through previous experiments that water spray had more consistent positioning at high flow rates. However, the flow rate is limited by the number of strings that can fit in a finite space, so the subteam decided to explore other variables that may affect flow positioning first.

'Impact location' in the following sections will refer to the location that water from the orifice strikes the deflector plate.

**Materials:**
- flat sheet of plastic approximately 11 x 19 cm
- sharpie
- water column with different orifice sizes (See jet_flow_rate and first summer report for fabrication instructions)

**Experimental Setup:**
- Draw a dot with 5 mm diameter in the center of the piece of plastic
- Draw 3 concentric circles around the dot with diameters of 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm to form a target area.
- Place the plastic sheet on an elevated, but flat surface
- Position the water column above the plastic sheet such that the orifice is directly above the center of the target. The distance between the orifice and the plastic sheet should be about 18.5 cm. Secure the water column so that it cannot move.
- place a large container underneath the entire apparatus to contain water spillage
- place the effluent tube of the peristaltic pump into the top of the water column and secure it with tape

## Experiment 1

**Goal: determine the influence of the peristaltic pump on the precision of water positioning**

### Experiment 1.1

**Goal:** Show that water turbulence in the column creates inconsistency in impact location.

Turbulence and bubbles were created in the water column by aiming the peristaltic pump tubing towards the surface of the water. A flow without bubbles was created by submerging the tube into the water.

**Procedure:**
- turn on the peristaltic pump and increase the RPM until the water height in the column equilibrates to 2.5 cm. An RPM of 170 was used.
- secure the peristaltic pump tubing about 7 cm above the water surface in the column
- video record the target area and also the water in the column for 10 seconds
- move and secure the peristaltic pump tubing so that it is submerged in the water
- video record the target area and also the water in the column for 10 seconds
- compare the amount of time that the impact location spent in each ring of the target

**Results:**
- When the tube from the pump was above the water, the stream of water from the orifice stayed within a 1 cm radius circle
- When the tube was underwater the water stayed within a 5 mm radius circle
- Having the tube above the water caused more turbulence in the water column; air bubbles were mixed in the water and caused the stream from the orifice to be more random
- With the tube above water, the stream from the orifice was less steady and it broke up into individual droplets several centimeters before hitting the target area. With the tube underwater, the flow from the orifice was a relatively steady stream for almost the whole distance to the target.

**Conclusions:**
Submerging the peristaltic pump tubing increased the impact location precision. Above the water, the impact location was limited to a 10 mm radius circle, while submerged it was limited to a 5 mm radius circle. Additionally, this difference in precision may be caused by turbulence and air bubbles in the water column.

**Edit: (7/17/19)** A flow accumulator was added after the peristaltic pump. And water was again sprayed on the 'target'. For this trial the water stayed within the 5 mm radius circle. Therefore the peristaltic pump did not improve the impact location consistency. No further changes will be made to the apparatus at this time to improve impact location consistency, as the current state is good enough for our purposes.
