# Moving Target

**Problem Statement:** Water flowing from the orifice does not hit the deflector plate in a constant location. This is a problem, because it makes it very difficult to position the water column over the deflector plate where it will create a good spray. Potential solutions include designing a deflector plate where the 'target area' for the influent water does not need to be as precise, or seeing if any parameters of the experimental apparatus can be changed to make the water positioning more consistent.

**Parameters that may affect water positioning on deflector plate**
- flow rate
- size of the orifice
- distance between the orifice and deflector plate
- uneven pulsing from the peristaltic pump

We observed through previous experiments that water spray had more consistent positioning at high flow rates. However, the flow rate is limited by the number of strings that can fit in a finite space, so the subteam decided to explore other variables that may affect flow positioning first.

'Impact location' in the following sections will refer to the location that water from the orifice strikes the deflector plate.

**Materials:**
- flat sheet of plastic approximately 11 x 19 cm
- sharpie
- water column with different orifice sizes (See jet_flow_rate and first summer report for fabrication instructions)

**Experimental Setup:**
- Draw a dot with 5 mm diameter in the center of the piece of plastic
- Draw 3 concentric circles around the dot with diameters of 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm to form a target area.
- Place the plastic sheet on an elevated, but flat surface
- Position the water column above the plastic sheet such that the orifice is directly above the center of the target. The distance between the orifice and the plastic sheet should be about 18.5 cm. Secure the water column so that it cannot move.
- place a large container underneath the entire apparatus to contain water spillage
- place the effluent tube of the peristaltic pump into the top of the water column and secure it with tape

## Experiment 1

**Goal: determine the influence of the peristaltic pump on the precision of water positioning**

### Experiment 1.1

**Goal:** Show that water turbulence in the column creates inconsistency in impact location.

Turbulence and bubbles were created in the water column by aiming the peristaltic pump tubing towards the surface of the water. A flow without bubbles was created by submerging the tube into the water.

**Procedure:**
- turn on the peristaltic pump and increase the RPM until the water height in the column equilibrates to 2.5 cm. An RPM of 170 was used.
- secure the peristaltic pump tubing about 7 cm above the water surface in the column
- video record the target area and also the water in the column for 10 seconds
- move and secure the peristaltic pump tubing so that it is submerged in the water
- video record the target area and also the water in the column for 10 seconds
- compare the amount of time that the impact location spent in each ring of the target

**Results:**
- When the tube from the pump was above the water, the stream of water from the orifice stayed within a 1 cm radius circle
- When the tube was underwater the water stayed within a 5 mm radius circle
- Having the tube above the water caused more turbulence in the water column; air bubbles were mixed in the water and caused the stream from the orifice to be more random
- With the tube above water, the stream from the orifice was less steady and it broke up into individual droplets several centimeters before hitting the target area. With the tube underwater, the flow from the orifice was a relatively steady stream for almost the whole distance to the target.

**Conclusions:**
Submerging the peristaltic pump tubing increased the impact location precision. Above the water, the impact location was limited to a 10 mm radius circle, while submerged it was limited to a 5 mm radius circle. Additionally, this difference in precision may be caused by turbulence and air bubbles in the water column.

**Edit: (7/17/19)** A flow accumulator was added after the peristaltic pump. And water was again sprayed on the 'target'. For this trial the water stayed within the 5 mm radius circle. Therefore the flow accumulator did not improve the impact location consistency. No further changes will be made to the apparatus at this time to improve impact location consistency, as the current state is good enough for our purposes.

### Methods
#### Design Parameters
##### Minimizing water impact location area
The location where the water jet exiting the orifice above the deflector plate - the impact location - influences the shape of the resulting spray pattern. A better and more consistent spray is created when the impact location of the jet is precise, meaning the target area where the water hits the deflector is small. Parameters that cause changes in the impact location on the deflector plate include: flow rate, orifice size, distance between orifice and deflector plate, and pulsing from the peristaltic pump used to pump water into the water column.  

While flow rate and orifice size are already limited by the number of strings and the potential for clogging, the subteam decided to explore the effect of the peristaltic pump on the impact location. Using the water column and peristaltic pump set up used in the converging strings design (*see experimental apparatus*), a circular target was drawn on a flat sheet of plastic and placed 18.5 cm under the orifice so the team could observe and quantify how the impact location varied.

The main goal of this experiment was to determine the influence of the peristaltic pump on the precision of water positioning. The team aimed to show that water turbulence in the column creates inconsistency in impact location. Positioning the effluent tubing from the pump either above or below the water level in the water column caused different levels of turbulence. With the tubing above the water level, more air bubbles mixed with the water and caused more inconsistency in impact location; when the tubing was at the bottom of the water column (submerged in water) less bubbles formed and the impact location was more precise because the flow from the orifice was steadier.

### Results and Analysis
#### Impact Location
Analyzing the videos taken during the experiment and comparing the results of the two trials resulted in the conclusion that submerging the peristaltic pump tubing increased the impact location precision. In the video where the tubing is submerged, the impact location remained inside the 1 cm diameter circle. But for the trial where the tubing was above the water, the impact location was more random and only remained within the 2 cm diameter circle. This difference in target area was caused by a higher level of turbulence in the water column; air bubble were mixed in the water and caused the stream from the orifice to be more random. Additionally, with the tube above water, the stream from the orifice was less steady and broke up into individual droplets several centimeters before hitting the target. But with the tube underwater, the flow from the orifice was more uniform and the stream was steady for almost the entire distance to the target.

After running these experiments and observing how the turbulence in the water column affected the impact location precision, a flow accumulator was added to the set-up after the peristaltic pump. With the flow accumulator, water stayed within the 1 cm diameter circle. Therefore, the flow accumulator did not improve the impact location consistency.

Impact location precision is important for maintaining a constant spray from the deflector plate. However, as observed from the teams experiments, water flowing from an orifice does not hit the deflector in a constant location. Getting the target area of the impact as small as possible was the goal of this experiment and a circular area of 1 cm was achieved when the effluent tubing from a peristaltic pump was underwater.
