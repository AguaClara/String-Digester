# Moving Target

**Problem Statement:** Water flowing from the orifice does not hit the deflector plate in a constant location. This is a problem, because it makes it very difficult to position the water column over the deflector plate where it will create a good spray. Potential solutions include designing a deflector plate where the 'target area' for the influent water does not need to be as precise, or seeing if any parameters of the experimental apparatus can be changed to make the water positioning more consistent.

**Parameters that may affect water positioning on deflector plate**
- flow rate
- size of the orifice
- distance between the orifice and deflector plate
- uneven pulsing from the peristaltic pump

We observed through previous experiments that water spray had more consistent positioning at high flow rates. However, the flow rate is limited by the number of strings that can fit in a finite space, so the subteam decided to explore other variables that may affect flow positioning first. The uneven pulsing from the peristaltic pump could be reduced by adding a flow accumulator between the pump and the water column. However, this did not become a main focus, because the same positioning problem also occurred at low flow rates from the sink.

'Water Position' in the following sections will refer to the location that water from the orifice strikes the deflector plate.

## Experiment 1

**Goal:** Determine whether the orifice size influences the precision of the water position.
